The authors delve into uncharted territory, exploring the implications of a unique measure of hedge funds’ exposures to the returns of green-minus-brown (GMB) portfolios. Their findings reveal a significant dispersion in hedge funds’ GMB portfolio tilts, with these tilts proving to be a reliable predictor of future performance. Funds with top-decile GMB betas (“green funds”) consistently outperform funds with GMB betas in the bottom decile, a discovery that piques the interest of the academic and finance communities. This fund-picking strategy, which involves holding hedge funds with high covariance to green portfolios (Decile 1) and shorting those with high covariance to brown portfolios (Decile 10) for one month, capitalizes on the ESG factor’s impact on fund performance, and we add it to our database as interesting acquisition. The difference in performance is not just statistically significant, but also economically meaningful at about 6% per year.

Fundamental reason
Hedge funds also exploit green stock price fluctuations related to climate concerns. Analyzing hedge fund portfolio holdings shows that the superior performance of green funds can be attributed to stock selection skills. A copycat portfolio of green stocks held by hedge funds outperforms a benchmark portfolio of green stocks, and the hedge funds’ holdings of put options tend to precede large drawdowns in the valuations of green stocks. Although green hedge funds generate high returns when climate concerns are high, their outperformance in risk-adjusted returns is highest during low climate concerns. In addition, using option trades, hedge funds can consistently time their bearish and bullish bets when climate concerns are associated with stock price movements. Hedge funds overweight low carbon emission intensity stocks relative to the green market portfolio. Their results support the view that only the actual green hedge funds (as measured by the green nature of their portfolios) received more flows during the most recent period – those who only self-describe as green did not.

These findings are consistent with (Zhang, 2023) and suggest that the source of hedge fund outperformance is not the high exposure to carbon-transition risk (e.g., Bolton and Kacperczyk, 2021). Despite their ability to anticipate the returns on green stocks, hedge funds cannot anticipate green innovation. Indeed, their green (or brown) portfolio tilts hold fewer patents than the market portfolio, and companies held by hedge funds also apply for fewer green patents. While existing studies show that UNPRI-signatory hedge funds (Liang et al., 2022) receive more flows than non-signatories, we find that GMB beta positively predicts flows, especially in the more recent sample period. In contrast, after controlling for the green beta, the UNPRI signatories or ESG-compliant hedge funds no longer receive significantly more flows than during the early period.

Simple trading strategy
Our strategy begins with the utilization of a comprehensive and consolidated hedge fund database, which includes BarclayHedge, Eurekahedge, Hedge Fund Management (HFM), Hedge Fund Research (HFR), Lipper TASS, and Morningstar, proceed to merge these databases using the matching procedure outlined in the Data Appendix of Joenväärä, Kauppila, Kosowski, and Tolonen (2021), a process that we have mastered, to create your investment universe.

 

Calculation:

1. The authors calculate the difference between green and brown portfolios, representing the ESG factor.

2. Then, compute the covariance of hedge funds with this indicator over 24 months.

3. Proceed to sort hedge funds into decile portfolios based on the GMB beta, estimated using the 24 most recent return observations.

 

Performance Execution:

Buy and hold funds with the highest covariance to green (Decile 1) for one year and (borrow to sell) short those with the highest covariance to brown (Decile 10). Liquidate at EOY.

 

The investment strategy is based on the GMB betas, whose final portfolio is rebalanced annually each December. Weight stocks are in the long and short baskets separately.

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
No - The strategy focuses on ethical investing and uses fundamental and technical indicators for stock selection, but it lacks specific mechanisms for hedging against market downturns, such as inverse ETFs or options, making it less effective in bear markets.
