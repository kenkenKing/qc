Factor timing, a popular investment strategy that combines factor investing and market timing, has received significant attention in recent years, especially in the context of using deep learning methods.

In this paper, the authors employ a neural network approach to investigate factor timing in the Chinese stock market and compare the performance of different strategies. The authors use a dataset of 146 characteristics-based factors and compare three factor timing strategies: unconditional, conditional OLS-based, and conditional NN3-based. They find that the conditional NN3-based strategy generates the highest returns, lowest standard deviations, highest Sharpe ratios, and certainty equivalent return gains compared to the other two strategies. The study also shows that the traditional factor models cannot absorb the returns of the conditional NN3-based factor timing approach. Finally, the authors investigate the economic grounds of the conditional NN3-based portfolio and find that quality- and profitability-related factors are important in the first principal component.

This research also helps the understanding of the Chinese stock market and factor timing. This paper shows the superior performance of factor timing in China, extending the application of factor timing in the emerging market.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of this research is to investigate and analyze the effectiveness of factor timing strategies in the Chinese stock market using deep learning techniques. The research aims to explore the economic grounds behind factor timing and its potential benefits for investors in China. By using a large dataset of 146 characteristics-based factors, the research employs principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension and builds three factor timing strategies, including an unconditional strategy, a conditional deep learning-based strategy, and a conditional ordinary least squares (OLS)-based strategy. The research is significant because it provides insights into the effectiveness of factor timing strategies in capturing the autocorrelation structure and predictability among factors, particularly in an emerging market like China. The use of deep learning techniques in factor timing is also noteworthy, as it helps to capture nonlinear interactions between factors and provides better predictability and robustness across subsamples than traditional linear or tree models. The findings of the research indicate that the conditional NN3-based factor timing strategy generates the highest average returns, the lowest standard deviations, the highest Sharpe ratios, and certainty equivalent return (CER) gains compared to the other two strategies. The results highlight the economic benefits of factor timing strategies using deep learning in China and demonstrate their potential to outperform traditional factor models.

Data
The authors obtained data from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) for the period of January 2004 to December 2020, including financial reports, monthly and daily stock returns, and the risk-free rate. They excluded stocks with special treatment (ST) and/or particular transfer (PT) status to ensure data quality. They constructed 146 portfolios based on various factors, such as accruals, debt issuance, investment, leverage, momentum, profitability, size, and value, following the approach of Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen (2021). They used monthly factor returns, defined as the difference between the average return of the top decile and the bottom decile, to analyze the explanatory ability of different factors in China. The authors claim using factor clusters and introducing more clusters may improve the predictability of machine learning in their factor timing strategy.

Factor Timing Methodology
Investor’s Problem. The authors in seciton 2.2. focused on the investor maximization problem under mean-variance preference for a single-period investor who allocates wealth into N risky assets and a risk-free asset. The investor aims to maximize the conditional expected utility subject to a budget constraint. The investor’s portfolio allocation or weight in risky assets is determined based on Aït-Sahalia and Brandt’s approach. The mean-variance preference is represented by a standard objective utility function that considers expected wealth and variance of wealth, with a parameter for the investor’s risk aversion.

Unconditional Portfolio Choice. The authors uses principal component analysis (PCA) to extract dominant components from 146 characteristic-based factors in order to address the issue of high dimensionality in the “factor zoo” era. The first four principal components (PCs) explain a significant portion of the total variation in realized returns. The paper estimates eigenvectors and eigenvalues using the first half of the data to avoid look-ahead bias. The harmonic mean of PCs’ contribution to the total variance of returns should be higher than the ratio of total R^2 to the maximum squared Sharpe ratio, as per the assumption of previous studies. Based on the variance explained in Table 1, the first four or five sparse PCs are suggested as the asset space. The study then focuses on these four PCs to create three different factor timing strategies. The unconditional strategy, which serves as the benchmark, sets the expected return based on the averaged monthly returns of the PCs from January 2004 to December 2011, as per Equation (7). These strategies are evaluated using out-of-sample data from January 2012 to December 2020.

Conditional Portfolio Choice. The authors propose two portfolio choices with different methods to predict portfolio returns: a conditional factor timing approach using a deep learning method called feed-forward neural network (FFN). They train the FFN with data from 2004 to 2011 and use it to forecast portfolio returns from 2012 to 2020. The FFN has multiple hidden layers with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. The authors compare this approach with an ordinary least squares (OLS) approach. They also estimate the conditional covariance matrix of the portfolio returns and create three factor timing strategies: one unconditional, one using the FFN, and one employing OLS for out-of-sample periods. The timing of factors differs based on expected factor returns in the three strategies after 2011.

Empirical Results. In section 3.1. the authors present the results of three factor timing approaches, including unconditional, conditional OLS, and conditional NN3-based portfolio choices, for investors with different risk aversion parameters. They find that the conditional NN3-based portfolio delivers the highest mean returns and lowest variances among the three strategies, with remarkably large annualized Sharpe ratios. The authors also observe significant economic benefits from timing factors with the deep learning method, as evidenced by large CER gains and considerable cumulative returns compared to market returns. Overall, the deep learning-based factor timing strategy outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy and the OLS-based portfolio, creating economic gains.

Yes - The conditional NN3-based factor timing strategy suits the 2015 Chinese stock market crash sub-sample well and continues to exist and remains robust for the market crash moment.
