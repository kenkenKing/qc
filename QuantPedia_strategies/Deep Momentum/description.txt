The paper presents a novel approach to asset return prediction using machine learning, focusing on momentum as the primary information source. Unlike existing models, this paper’s innovation lies in reconciling the gap between machine learning predictions and financial performance, substantially enhancing prediction accuracy. The model employs a deep neural network to estimate stock return distributions and combines them with other information to predict financial performance. Through a reclassification process, termed Deep Momentum (DM), the model improves portfolio performance compared to traditional machine learning models, even under transaction costs. The study introduces five reclassification methods, addressing data imbalances and yielding impressive results. Testing on US stocks from 1975 to 2017, the DM model consistently outperforms standard momentum strategies and factor models. The paper’s contributions extend to identifying momentum stock bimodality, demonstrating the importance of financial performance alignment, and emphasizing modeling’s role in enhancing stock return predictability. The simplicity of the proposed model highlights its robustness and effectiveness within the context of machine learning-driven asset pricing.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of this paper stems from its novel approach to machine learning-based asset return prediction and portfolio construction. It seeks to reconcile the disparity between machine learning predictions and financial performance, employing deep neural networks to estimate return distributions and predict financial outcomes. Through reclassification, it mitigates the bimodality issue in momentum stocks, resulting in superior portfolio performance compared to conventional models. This “Deep Momentum” (DM) framework goes beyond the traditional momentum strategy by leveraging hidden nonlinear information. The paper addresses data imbalance in portfolio construction and introduces five effective reclassification methods. Empirical tests spanning several decades confirm the DM model’s robustness and profitability, outperforming traditional strategies even under transaction costs. By reconciling machine learning predictions with investment objectives, the paper highlights the importance of financial performance in asset pricing models. Its discovery of a high Sharpe ratio based solely on past returns prompts questions about the role of features and models in asset pricing. Overall, the paper advances asset pricing literature, offering a fresh perspective on enhancing stock return predictability through machine learning.

Simple trading strategy
The authors use US equity market data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), covering stocks listed on NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq from 1955.01 to 2017.01. They impose conditions on data collection and filtering, resulting in 22,919 firms for analysis. The training and testing periods are split, with the first 20 years used for training and subsequent years for testing. The authors classify stocks into deciles using machine learning models and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, loss, and other metrics. Reclassification strategies are applied to enhance classification performance, and the effects of these strategies are analyzed. The paper also investigates the financial performance of portfolios constructed based on the classification results. The results indicate superior performance of the proposed model in terms of returns and Sharpe ratios compared to alternative strategies and models.

Section 2 of the paper investigates bimodal characteristics in stock returns, focusing on the cross-sectional distribution of momentum stock returns. The study uses US market data from 1955 to 2017, categorizing stocks into ten momentum groups based on one-year price momentum. The resulting probability mass functions are referred to as cross-sectional relative return distributions. High-momentum stocks tend to yield high returns and populate high-return groups, while low-momentum stocks yield lower returns and populate low-return groups. The section illustrates these distributions and highlights the persistence of bimodality, especially among extreme deciles. The bimodal pattern is not limited to one-year momentum but is found across various momentum features. The paper further explores changes during market recessions and recoveries, revealing shifts in the distribution of low-momentum stocks. Bimodality isn’t unique to momentum; other firm characteristics like beta, book-to-market ratio, liquidity, size, and volatility also exhibit bimodal distributions. This suggests a connection between bimodality and return predictability. Despite this bimodal pattern, high-momentum stocks still indicate higher future returns, motivating further investigation into enhancing momentum’s predictive power.

The paper in the section 3 focuses on building the deep momentum strategy through machine learning. It discusses the background and methods for improving the predictive power of momentum using nonlinear relationships and multiple features. Two main approaches are presented: multiclass classification and regression.
In the multiclass classification approach, the goal is to predict a stock’s future return class, similar to traditional quantile-based models. This approach is suitable for relative return strategies and can also be extended to predict absolute returns. Machine learning algorithms like random forests and artificial neural networks are used for this supervised learning problem.
The regression approach aims to forecast absolute stock returns by minimizing the difference between realized and predicted returns. Although this approach has been successful in predicting absolute returns, cross-sectional prediction has shown greater success in asset pricing literature. Given the bimodal nature of relative return distribution, a point estimate is insufficient, so the paper adopts the multiclass classification approach.
To implement this approach, a deep neural network (DNN) is employed for stock classification. The DNN estimates probabilities for each return class and assigns the class with the highest probability as the predicted class. The section introduces a nominal classifier and discusses its training process.
The paper also highlights challenges in implementing machine learning for asset pricing, including potential mismatches between predicted and actual classes and imbalanced class distributions. To address these issues, the paper introduces five reclassification methods.

In the context of building the deep momentum strategy, the paper discusses two main approaches to formulating the return prediction problem using machine learning: multiclass classification and regression.

Multiclass Classification Approach:

Input (Features):
The input features (explanatory variables) are denoted as x = {x1, …, xM}, where M represents the number of features.
Output (Target):
The target variable is denoted as c, which represents the predicted class (future return class) for a given stock. The true class is represented as y, using a one-hot encoding scheme. If the stock’s possible return classes are 1, …, K, and the true class is k, then c = k and y is a K-dimensional vector with the k-th element equal to 1 and the rest as 0.

Objective:
The objective of this approach is to predict a stock’s future return class. This is akin to traditional cross-sectional prediction models, where stocks are sorted based on a predictor and classified into quantiles.

Problem Type: This approach is suited for relative return strategies, such as long-short strategies. It can also be extended to predict absolute returns. Since future returns are known in the training sample, this is a supervised learning problem.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Machine learning offers various multiclass classification algorithms for this purpose, such as random forest and artificial neural networks.

Regression Approach:

Input (Features): Similar to the multiclass classification approach, the input features are denoted as x = {x1, …, xM}.

Output (Target): The target variable is the absolute return of a stock.

Objective: The objective is to forecast the absolute return of a stock by minimizing the difference between realized returns and predicted returns.

Problem Type: This approach involves regression, where the predicted output is a continuous value.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Machine learning studies in asset pricing have often adopted this regression approach to predict absolute returns.

In the multiclass classification approach, a deep neural network (DNN) is employed for stock classification. The DNN estimates the probability for each return class and selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class. This approach offers a discretized version of the stock’s return distribution.

Input: The input features x.

Output: The predicted class c and the associated probabilities for each class, P(c = k) for k = 1, …, K.

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
Yes - The authors also developed a dynamically hedged momentum strategy that significantly outperforms an unhedged approach. DM strategy shows superior performance during a momentum crash period. When the market recovers, losers perform better than winners and have higher short-term returns (MOM1M). Remarkably, these long-short strategies do not suffer from momentum crashes. While the equal-weighted variant appears to perform better when stocks are value-weighted, it suffered enormous losses during the momentum crash in 2009. JT’s long-short portfolio also fell into deep negative territory during the momentum crash around 2009.
