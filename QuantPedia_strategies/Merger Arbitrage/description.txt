Merger arbitrage is a market-neutral form of trading that seeks to exploit inefficiencies in the stock price of a company that has agreed to be sold to another company for cash, stock, or a combination of both. The strategy could be implemented by active stock trading or by buying specialized ETF or funds.

Fundamental reason
Because of this slight uncertainty, the target company’s stock will typically sell at a discount to the price that the combined company will have when the merger is closed. This discrepancy is the arbitrageur’s profit. Quasi-market neutrality is accomplished because stocks are simultaneously bought (target) and sold (acquirer).

Simple trading strategy
The universe consists of all announced mergers. The narrow deal universe includes only North American and European merger deals with the following liquidity features:
– Target has a market cap of > $500 M
– Target has sufficient trading volume
– Acquirer for stock deals is easy to borrow
Apply systematic constraints to ensure deals have arbitrage potential:
– Positive acquisition premium
– Offer is for substantially all shares outstanding of target
– The acquirer does not already own all of the target’s shares substantially

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
No - Merger arbitrage strategy suffers bad performance during preliminary stages of crises. Therefore it is not recommended as a hedge/diversification of equity market factor during bear markets.
