The authors introduce a measure called Abnormal Trading Volume (ATV) persistence, which captures the length of the period in that investor sentiment is persistently high or low. As a result, ATV positively predicts stock returns in the short run; this positive return predictability primarily arises from stocks recently affected by investor sentiment (i.e., stocks with short ATV persistence). On top of that, a new variable, PATV (Persistence in ATV), which proxies for the sentiment persistence of a stock and is estimated by the number of consecutive months the stock’s ATV being in the top or bottom decile, is proposed, its validity thoughtfully tested, and we base our main presented strategy on the use of its statistical power.

Fundamental reason
Academia has widely studied the relationship between trading volume and future stock return. Yet, no convincing explanation has fully explained the complex return pattern following the occurrence of ATV (Abnormal Trading Volume). Scientists from this study now offer a novel explanation by focusing on investor sentiment’s persistence and reversal impacts on stock prices. Stocks that have been impacted by sentiment for a prolonged period (i.e., stocks with long ATV persistence) are more likely to experience return reversals since their investor sentiment is less likely to persist further. Consistent with the cumulative impact of investor sentiment on stock prices, they show that ATV persistence negatively predicts long-run stock returns. The strength of the return predictability monotonically increases as the length of ATV persistence increases. As a result, ATV persistence can outperform the commonly used ATV measure in predicting stock returns, highlighting the importance of considering the effects of sentiment persistence and reversal on asset prices.


Simple trading strategy
The investment universe includes common stocks listed on AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ. 1. ATV of stock in a month 𝑚 𝐴𝑇𝑉𝑚 is estimated as the logarithm of the change in trading volume relative to the past 12-month average (a division of actual trading volume in month 𝑚 and the average trading volume of the stock over month 𝑚 ‒ 18 through month 𝑚 ‒ 7). (Investor should skip six months in determining the reference period to minimize data contamination because ATV persistence [ATVP] variable requires ATVs of five consecutive months. [Similar to the approach found in Chae (2005). However, scientists claim results remain robust without skipping six months.]) For every stock in the top and bottom ATV deciles in a given month, we count the number of consecutive months the stock has been in the same decile and coin it as PATV. For example, if a stock is observed in the top (bottom) ATV decile in months 𝑚, 𝑚 ‒ 1 and 𝑚 ‒ 2 but is not in that decile in month 𝑚 ‒ 3, we assign this stock with a persistence PATV value of 3 (‒ 3) for month 𝑚. Notation 𝑃𝐴𝑇𝑉(𝑥, ‒ 𝑥) denotes created long-short portfolios with PATV(𝑥) and PATV(‒ 𝑥) values. 2. At the beginning of any given month 𝑚, our selected variant of PATV strategy forms and holds monthly portfolios that long (short) stocks persistently ranked in the top (bottom) of ATV decile, with an equal length (one month) of ATV persistence (that means ATV for portfolio formation has a lag of 1 month). 3. The portfolio is then rebalanced monthly, and each of the positions initiated over the current month and the previous 𝑘 ‒ 1 months carries a weight of 1/𝑘 [equal(ly) weight(ed)].

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
Yes - The PATV strategies can also deliver a higher Sharpe ratio than the market and do not suffer from the extreme crash risk of momentum strategies. Returns from the strategies based on PATV are robust to risk adjustments and subject to less crash risk than momentum.
