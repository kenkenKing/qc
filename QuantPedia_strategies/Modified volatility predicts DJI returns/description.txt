According to the authors, adjusted long-term volatility has a significantly positive impact on future stock returns, in contrast to the negative impact of short-term stock realized variance. In addition, when the interference information of short-term volatility is removed from the long-term volatility information, the adjusted long-term volatility indicator can quickly adapt to the market status and capture the net long-term volatility information. As a result, the key variable, adjusted long-term volatility (ADJ_LV), is used to time the market and, with a very high probability, predict future returns; thus creating an ultimate strategy switching between equities’ indices and free-rate risk-free assets.

Fundamental reason
Adjusted long-term volatility has excellent out-of-sample performance in forecasting stock returns and performs better in combination with some popular predictors. More importantly, the positive risk-return relationship found with the adjusted long-term volatility indicator is in line with the prediction of asset pricing theory. Relationships between different types of volatilities and returns are rich, starting from the ’60s, but still puzzling quants, scientists and analysts to date. Research of Qiu, Rui and Liu, Jing and Li, Yan (2022) makes an important contribution to the literature on forecasting stock returns with the adjusted long-term volatility measure and helps understand the complex empirical relationship between volatility and expected returns in the literature.

Simple trading strategy
The investment universe consists of single instrument tracking exposure to DJI index (for example, DIA ETF) and cash (for example, BIL). Regression 𝐴𝐷𝐽_𝐿𝑉𝑡 = 𝐿𝑉𝑡 ‒ 𝛽𝑜𝑙𝑠,𝑡 ∙ 𝑆𝑉𝑡 where independent variables long-term volatility 𝐿𝑉𝑡, which is the standard deviation of DJI monthly returns over the past 24 months, annualized by multiplying by the square of 12 and annualized short-term volatility 𝑆𝑉𝑡 as in Welch and Goyal (2008) modified by using the beta of OLS as from the equation on page 9, estimates us dependant variable adjusted long-term volatility 𝐴𝐷𝐽_𝐿𝑉𝑡. The investor allocates wealth between the stock index security and a risk-free rate, and the investor determines the optimal weight of the holding stock index according to 𝜔^∗_𝑡 = 𝑟_𝑡+1/(𝛾 * 𝜎_𝑡+1^2) where 𝑟_𝑡+1 is the return forecast at month t+1, 𝛾=3 is the risk aversion parameter, and 𝜎_𝑡+1^2 denotes the estimated stock variance by using the variance of stock returns over the previous 60 months (t, t-1, t-2, …, t-59). The regression formula to calculate dependant 𝑟_𝑖,𝑡 can be found on page 17; the next month’s return is calculated from regression, in which now the independent variable is adjusted long-term volatility. The initial period for estimation is 60 months. The portfolio is weighted according to factor and assumed to be rebalanced monthly.

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
Yes - According to the cited paper, there are few negative values of adjusted long-term volatility, most of which correspond to the global economic crisis of 2007 to 2009. Discussion in the paper and the presented strategy offer an option to produce a workaround to mitigate draw-downs associated with plain exposure to the stock market.
