The paper investigates the performance of machine learning models in predicting stock returns across different prediction horizons and the impact of trading costs on their effectiveness. While machine learning strategies have shown promise in capturing complex relationships between stock characteristics and future returns, most prior research focused on predicting returns at a one-month horizon, neglecting turnover and transaction costs. The paper demonstrates that the strong performance of these strategies is concentrated in the period before 2004 and that strategies predicting one-month returns experience performance decay afterward. To address this, the study introduces efficient portfolio construction rules to enhance post-2004 performance and compares strategies with various prediction horizons. The findings highlight that longer-horizon prediction strategies, while yielding lower raw returns, outperform shorter-horizon strategies when considering trading costs due to reduced turnover. The paper also discusses the changing asset pricing characteristics that influence machine learning predictions at different horizons and emphasizes the importance of incorporating trading costs into strategy evaluation. Finally, the study showcases how adapting prediction horizons and employing efficient portfolio construction rules can lead to improved performance after accounting for transaction costs, providing valuable insights for both academics and investment practitioners.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of the strategy described in this paper lies in its ability to leverage non-linear machine learning models, such as neural networks and tree-based models, to capture complex relationships between stock characteristics and future returns. These models excel in identifying intricate patterns and interactions within stock data that traditional linear models might miss. By utilizing these advanced models, the strategy can effectively predict returns across different prediction horizons. The strategy’s success also stems from its consideration of longer prediction horizons and the incorporation of efficient portfolio construction rules. By extending the prediction horizons beyond the commonly studied one-month period, the strategy is able to adapt to changing market dynamics and asset pricing characteristics. Additionally, the use of portfolio construction rules that mitigate trading costs plays a crucial role in enhancing the strategy’s performance. These rules help in managing the impact of turnover, which is particularly important when considering transaction costs. Furthermore, the strategy demonstrates the ability to adapt to different asset pricing characteristics depending on the prediction horizon. In the short-term horizon, it capitalizes on high-turnover short-term signals, while in longer horizons, it focuses on more stable Quality and Value related signals. This adaptability allows the strategy to capture different sources of predictive power at different time scales.

Trading Strategy: Predictive Portfolio Construction Utilizing Machine Learning

1. Data Collection and Preparation
Historical data for U.S. stocks listed on the NYSE, NYSE MKT, and NASDAQ exchanges from CRSP are collected. The dataset encompasses records from March 1957 to December 2021. Excess returns are computed for different prediction horizons, including one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month forward stock returns versus Treasury-bill risk-free rates.

2. Training of Machine Learning Models
Four distinct machine learning models are trained: ordinary least squares (OLS), elastic net (ENET), gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT), and a three-layer deep neural network (DNN3). These models are chosen to capture linear, non-linear, and interaction effects between asset pricing characteristics and excess returns. Additionally, an ensemble model (ENS) is formed by aggregating predictions from the four models. Training adheres to prior research by utilizing stock characteristics to predict future excess returns. The training process occurs on the training data (March 1957 to December 1974), with validation on the validation data (January 1975 to December 1986).

3. Portfolio Construction and Trading Rules
For the portfolio construction phase, efficient rules are implemented to mitigate trading costs. Specifically, the strategy employs the 10/50 buy-hold approach:

Formation of a long portfolio comprising stocks in the top X% (e.g., top 10%) based on predicted returns. These stocks have consistently ranked in the top Y% (e.g., top 50%) of stocks in previous months.
Formation of a short portfolio consisting of stocks in the bottom X% based on predicted returns. These stocks have consistently ranked in the bottom Y% of stocks in previous months.
4. Determination of Prediction Horizon
Net returns are calculated, accounting for trading costs (estimated at 25 basis points per trade). A comparison of net returns is made among portfolios created with different prediction horizons (1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month). The prediction horizon yielding the highest net returns after considering costs is selected.

5. Portfolio Evaluation and Monitoring
Continuous evaluation of the chosen portfolio’s performance is conducted. Metrics like net returns, adjusted R-squared values, turnover rates, and other relevant performance indicators are monitored. The strategy’s resilience in response to changing market conditions is regularly assessed.

The trading strategy harnesses machine learning models to forecast stock returns across diverse timeframes. It constructs portfolios utilizing effective trading rules to manage costs. By identifying the prediction horizon that maximizes net returns after factoring in costs, the strategy aims to achieve consistent and competitive performance in a dynamic market. It is important to note that successful implementation of this strategy demands meticulous data management, model training, and ongoing evaluation to ensure alignment with the objectives of investors.
