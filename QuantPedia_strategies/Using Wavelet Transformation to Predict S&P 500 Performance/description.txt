This paper discusses the challenging task of forecasting stock market returns and presents a novel approach to constructing a predictive model. The authors emphasize the importance of economic factors in driving stock market performance but note that traditional economic variables have limited forecasting ability. To overcome this limitation, they propose using the partial least squares (PLS) regression method, a supervised machine learning technique, to extract a common predictive component from a large set of macroeconomic variables. They introduce a new target variable, the aligned macroeconomic index (AMI), obtained through wavelet frequency domain decomposition of monthly stock returns. The authors compare their approach with existing methods and find that AMI outperforms other predictors in both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts of stock market returns. They also evaluate the economic value of their forecasts and show that the portfolio performance based on AMI predictions is impressive. The authors further investigate the asymmetric forecasting power of different predictors during high and low economic uncertainty periods and find that AMI performs better in high uncertainty times, indicating market underreaction to fundamental trends. They explore the relationship between AMI and investor sentiment and find that they play complementary roles in predicting future market returns. Additionally, the authors analyze the source of AMIâ€™s predictive power and find evidence of predictability in both discount rates and cash flows. They conduct extended analyses to compare AMI with other machine learning methods, assess its ability to forecast characteristic portfolios, and examine the effect of estimation methods on predictive power.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of this paper is to address the challenge of forecasting stock market returns by proposing a novel approach that takes into account the frequency domain of stock return dynamics. The authors recognize that the state of the economy is closely linked to market returns, but traditional economic variables have limited forecasting ability. They aim to construct an informative proxy of the latent factor that drives the systematic variation of stock returns by eliminating noise components from macroeconomic variables and extracting the common predictive component that reflects the real economic fundamental.To achieve this goal, the authors employ the partial least squares (PLS) regression method, which is a simple and efficient supervised machine learning technique for dimensionality reduction. They choose the target variable as the long-term wavelet composition of stock returns, known as the aligned macroeconomic index (AMI), to better capture the gradual changes in the macroeconomic state. By utilizing the PLS method, the authors extract the most predictive common component from individual macroeconomic variables and aim to align the economic fundamental measure with the purpose of explaining the target variable.The functionality of this paper lies in its innovative approach of incorporating the frequency domain of stock return dynamics, employing the PLS regression method, and introducing the AMI as a proxy for the macroeconomic state.

1. Methodology
The authors describe the wavelet frequency domain decomposition technique they employ, specifically the discrete wavelet transform multiresolution analysis (DWT-MRA). This technique is used to decompose target sequences into different frequency components. The authors use the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) with a Haar wavelet filter and reflecting boundary conditions to decompose the stock return series into three components: one smooth component representing low-frequency behavior and two detail components representing middle and high-frequency behaviors. This decomposition allows them to express the original series as a combination of three subseries from different frequency domains.
The authors introduce the concept of an aligned macroeconomic index (AMI) and its estimation using the partial least squares (PLS) method. They assume a linear relation between the expected excess stock return and a macroeconomic state variable. The goal is to estimate the unobservable macroeconomic state variable based on a set of macroeconomic variables. The PLS method is applied, consisting of two steps of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. In the first step, time-series regressions are run for each individual macroeconomic variable to capture its sensitivity to the macroeconomic state. The choice of the macroeconomic state proxy is important, and the authors use the long-term component of stock returns. In the second step, cross-sectional regressions are performed to estimate the macroeconomic state, which becomes the aligned macroeconomic index. This index is aligned with forecasting stock returns as it discards irrelevant components and retains the most predictive information.
Finally, they compare the aligned macroeconomic index (AMI) with two other dimension reduction approaches: principal component (PC) and equally-weighed (EW) factors. PC is obtained through principal component analysis, while EW factors are simply the equally-weighted averages of the macroeconomic variables. Unlike AMI, PC and EW factors do not consider the target information (stock returns) and may not capture the useful information for forecasting stock returns.

2. Data
This paper analyzes the log excess return of the S&P500 index and 14 macroeconomic variables (see Table 1.). The data cover a period from January 1927 to December 2019 (1116 months) and have been widely used in previous studies on stock return prediction. The summary statistics indicate low autocorrelation in stock returns, high volatility, and most predictors exhibit high persistence. Among the partial least squares (PLS) factors, the aligned macroeconomic index (AMI) stands out with a close-to-zero average and skewness, suggesting its potential usefulness in forecasting stock returns.

3. Forecasting performance evaluation
In this part of the paper, the authors evaluate the forecasting performance of the AMI predictor and other competing predictors. They conduct an in-sample analysis to assess the performance of the predictors using a predictive regression model. They address potential issues related to spurious regression and small-sample bias and report the results of the regression analysis. They also perform an out-of-sample forecasting evaluation, comparing the forecasts generated by different predictors. The authors use evaluation metrics such as R-squared, Diebold-Mariano test, and Clark-West test to assess the accuracy and significance of the forecasts. Additionally, they conduct a forecast encompassing test to compare the forecasts generated by the AMI predictor with the competing predictors. For more details see section 4.
