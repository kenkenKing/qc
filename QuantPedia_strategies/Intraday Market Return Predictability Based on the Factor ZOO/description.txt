This paper delves into the central questions of whether the return on the aggregate stock market can be predicted and whether trading on such predictions can yield abnormal returns. These questions are at the core of the efficient market hypothesis and have been extensively examined in financial literature, primarily focusing on daily, monthly, and quarterly return horizons with mixed results. In contrast, this study employs high-frequency intraday returns and over two hundred cross-sectional risk factors, utilizing Machine Learning techniques to distill relevant information. The research uncovers compelling empirical evidence supporting the predictability of intraday market portfolio returns. Utilizing these predictions in a trading strategy for the SPY ETF yields a significantly higher annualized intraday transaction-cost-adjusted Sharpe ratio compared to a buy-and-hold strategy, along with a substantial annualized Fama-French six-factor risk-adjusted alpha. The predictability is linked to periods of heightened economic uncertainty and specific high-frequency factors related to liquidity and tail risk. This study contributes to the growing field of applying machine learning to finance while offering fresh insights into market frictions and information incorporation.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental rationale underpinning this paper’s research lies in the critical questions at the core of finance: Can we predict the returns of the aggregate stock market, and if so, can this prediction be leveraged to generate abnormal returns through trading strategies? These inquiries challenge the Efficient Market Hypothesis and have been extensively explored in financial literature. Previous research predominantly focused on daily, monthly, and quarterly return horizons and examined a limited set of predictor variables, yielding mixed results. In contrast, this study employs high-frequency intraday returns along with an extensive array of over two hundred cross-sectional risk factors. Leveraging Machine Learning techniques, the study aims to distill crucial information. The findings reveal strong empirical evidence supporting the predictability of intraday returns on the aggregate market portfolio. Notably, this predictability is associated with the gradual assimilation of new information and the influence of specific high-frequency factors, particularly those related to liquidity and tail risk. This research contributes to the evolving field of utilizing machine learning in finance and sheds new light on market frictions and information assimilation dynamics.

Simple trading strategy
Data:
The data used in this study encompasses high-frequency returns for 272 portfolios constructed by Aleti (2023), spanning from January 2, 1996, to December 31, 2020. These portfolios encompass 218 characteristic-sorted portfolios representing various factors from asset pricing literature, 48 industry portfolios summarizing sector-specific market movements, and 6 additional factor portfolios including the Fama-French 5 plus Momentum. To mitigate concerns regarding market microstructure noise, returns for all portfolios are sampled at a “coarse” 15-minute frequency, resulting in a total of 169,965 intraday return observations for each of the factors. The analysis reveals that most of the market’s returns occur during the overnight period, emphasizing the challenge of generating positive returns through intraday trading. Moreover, intraday market returns exhibit low serial correlation, with an average first-order autocorrelation coefficient of just 3.56%. The study examines the potential predictive power of these portfolios, demonstrating that while some individual portfolios offer significant predictive power, the vast majority do not. It becomes clear that more sophisticated real-time variable selection procedures are needed to identify effective predictors, especially considering the high correlations among many of these factors. This sets the stage for the subsequent discussion on prediction models and estimation procedures.

In the section 3., the continuous-time log-price process for both the market and factor portfolios is described, separating them into continuous and jump components. Different forecasting models, including a baseline model and variations that exclude jump components, are presented. The LASSO estimation procedure is introduced to handle the high-dimensional nature of the models and simultaneously select relevant predictors. The hyperparameter tuning process for LASSO is explained, involving a training/validation/testing split to optimize the model’s performance. This comprehensive methodology lays the foundation for predicting market returns in subsequent analyses, which will be evaluated using SHAP values to understand the driving factors behind the predictions.

In the section 4., the focus is to evaluating the out-of-sample forecasting performance of four model specifications for predicting 15-minute returns of the Fama-French market portfolio. The assessment is based on out-of-sample R2 values, which are compared to established benchmarks for expected predictability at high frequencies. The results show that while the R2 values are small, they surpass the benchmarks significantly, suggesting that the models capture some level of short-lived predictability. The “All, All” specification performs the best in terms of R2OOS. Diebold-Mariano tests confirm that all four models outperform a baseline based on average returns. However, when comparing the models against each other, there isn’t a clear statistical winner. The section sets the stage for a more in-depth economic evaluation of the models through the performance of trading strategies in the subsequent analysis.

In section 5, the authors examine the performance of different trading strategies for the Fama-French market portfolio based on the forecasting models discussed earlier. Three main trading strategies are considered:

1. Sign Strategy: This strategy takes long positions when the forecasted market return is positive and short positions when it’s negative. It treats long and short positions symmetrically.

2. Positive Strategy: This modification of the Sign strategy avoids short-selling by only going long when the forecasted return is positive and staying in cash when it’s negative.

3. Main Strategy: This strategy uses a more nuanced approach, taking into account the strength of the predictive signals. It goes long only when the forecasted return is strong enough relative to the noise (measured by a rolling standard deviation of forecast errors) and stays in the existing position otherwise.

Additionally, a simple buy-and-hold strategy is used as a benchmark.

The trading performance is evaluated in terms of intraday returns and intraday Sharpe ratios. Some the key findings:
All trading strategies outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in terms of average intraday returns.
The average intraday returns for all strategies, except the buy-and-hold strategy, are reported in annualized percentage form.
Intraday Sharpe ratios for all trading strategies are significantly higher than the buy-and-hold strategy.
While there is little systematic advantage to separating the regressors into continuous and discontinuous components in the forecasting models, the “Main” trading strategy benefits from using the continuous component of the market returns as the regressand.

These results suggest that timing the market based on the forecasting models can lead to superior intraday returns and improved risk-adjusted performance compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy for the Fama-French market portfolio.
