This paper introduces a novel approach to lead-lag detection in multivariate time series data, with a particular focus on its applications in the realm of finance. Lead-lag detection involves identifying time delays between similar patterns across different variables within a time series dataset. These identified lead-lag relationships are crucial for time series modeling, forecasting, and have relevance in various fields such as finance, econometrics, biology, and control systems. In the context of financial markets, understanding the lead-lag relationships between asset returns is essential for developing trading strategies. Discovering these relationships enables traders to use the returns of leading assets as indicators for lagging ones, potentially leading to profitable trading strategies. The paper acknowledges that lead-lag detection is not a new concept, but financial time series data present unique challenges, including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), non-Gaussian characteristics, and dynamic relationship fluctuations over time. To address these challenges, the paper introduces a novel framework that leverages Multiscale Robust Analysis (MRA) for lead-lag detection, emphasizing its suitability for financial data with low SNR. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, particularly when compared to traditional pairwise similarity measurement methods.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for lead-lag detection’s functionality lies in its ability to unveil the temporal relationships and time delays between similar patterns across variables within multivariate time series data. This capability serves as a critical component for a variety of applications, including time series modeling and forecasting, with implications reaching into various fields such as finance, econometrics, system identification, biology, and control. In the context of financial markets, lead-lag detection becomes especially valuable. It allows for the identification of lead-lag relationships among asset returns. This means that certain assets respond to market events and factor movements faster than others. This insight can be harnessed to establish trading strategies where the return of a leading asset serves as a leading indicator for the return of a lagging one. In essence, lead-lag detection empowers traders and analysts to profit from the temporal delay between these patterns, ultimately enhancing decision-making in the financial domain. Lead-lag detection’s functionality is fundamental for understanding the temporal relationships between variables in time series data, particularly in finance, where it enables the development of trading strategies based on lead-lag patterns. This paper’s contribution is to provide an innovative framework that addresses the unique challenges of financial data, demonstrating its potential for improving trading applications.

Simple trading strategy
1. Lead-lag Detection in Finance:
Previous studies in finance have explored lead-lag relationships. Large market cap stocks tend to lead smaller ones due to slow information diffusion, while high trading volume stocks often lead those with lower volumes. This paper introduces a data-driven approach for identifying leaders and laggards in the US equities market.

2. Multireference Alignment & Group Synchronization from Pairwise Measurements:
The paper’s approach involves time series modeling and calculating lead-lag scores between pairs of variables. It uses Multireference Alignment (MRA) and group synchronization to estimate signals from noisy shifted observations. This approach has applications in various fields, including structural biology and network clustering.

3. Ranking from Pairwise Measurements:
Ranking from pairwise comparisons is a common problem in machine learning. Various ranking algorithms, including spectral and SVD-based methods, can be applied to determine the leadership of an asset based on pairwise comparisons. These methods provide practical solutions with theoretical guarantees on accuracy.

Multireference Alignment
The Multireference Alignment (MRA) problem is explained in the section 3. The goal is to estimate an unknown factor series (x) from a set of N observed time series (yi), each of length T. The observations are affected by Gaussian noise (ϵi) and have cyclic shifts represented by the operator Rr. The main objective is to estimate the original signal x.
The paper presents two methods for addressing this problem:
Group Synchronization: This method involves obtaining estimations of pairwise lead-lag differences and then synchronizing these estimates to find the original shift vector. The algorithm used for synchronization is SVD-NRS2, which is a spectral method working on the matrix of pairwise lead-lag estimations.
Invariant-Feature Method (IVF): This approach is based on the estimation of signal features that are invariant under cyclic shifts. The algorithm constructs an optimization problem using these invariant features to estimate the original signal. This method works well even when the added noise is significant.
The paper also discusses how these methods can be applied to cases where there are multiple signals (heterogeneous MRA) and the observations are not perfectly cyclically shifted. The goal is to estimate the original signals (xk) and potentially the mixing probabilities of classes of observations (w).The implementation of these methods demonstrates their effectiveness in recovering signals from noisy and shifted observations, even in financial data where shifts may not be strictly cyclic.

Lead-Lag Detection Based on Cross-Correlation
The paper discusses the concept of correlation between two variables, which measures how their values change in the same direction. In the context of time series variables Xt and Yt with a length of T, the lag-n cross-correlation is the correlation between the n-shifted version of Xt and Yt. It is denoted and computed as Corr(Xt, Yt)[n].
The main focus is on capturing lead-lag relationships, particularly short-term intra-industry relationships, which tend to be stronger and less influenced by other factors compared to long-term inter-industry relationships. To estimate the lead-lag structure between time series Xt and Yt, the paper defines a lead-lag measure as Lb(Xt, Yt), which identifies the lag (lead) that maximizes the correlation.
Additionally, for a set of time series {Xn}N, if the interest is in lead-lag relationships within a specific bound δ, the paper defines a robust δ-bounded lead-lag measure as Lδ(Xi, Xj), which considers only lead-lag relationships within the specified range.
The paper also discusses how a reference variable Xet obtained from Multireference Alignment (MRA) can be used to construct a relative lag vector r, which represents the lag between each element in {Xn}N and the reference variable. This lag vector can be transformed into a pairwise lag matrix if needed for further analysis.

Clustering
In section 5, the paper focuses on clustering in the context of financial time series data, aiming to group similar objects within clusters. This clustering approach is essential for applications like forecasting, noise reduction, and portfolio selection. The paper explores the impact of sliding window width on the consistency and convergence of various clustering algorithms, considering the statistical properties of financial time series. It develops similarity measures tailored to financial time series to capture latent structures such as cross-asset lead-lag effects and growth behaviors.
Clustering simplifies complex problems by grouping data into classes with similar properties. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical PCA (HPCA) are commonly used to extract common risk factors and group assets based on their economic information. Clustering models can enhance lead-lag detection’s robustness against noise by grouping time series subsequences with similar lead-lag patterns. The paper evaluates the IVF MRA method’s ability to cluster observations generated by different source signals and compares the results with standard clustering methods.

Data Description
The paper utilizes real-world financial data from the Wharton CRSP dataset, consisting of daily close-to-close simple returns of 695 NYSE-traded stocks over 5279 trading days from January 3, 2000, to December 31, 2020. Pre-processing steps involve removing anomalous data and Winsorizing the simple returns to a specific interval.
For synthetic data experiments, the paper simulates data resembling financial time series to assess the clustering lead-lag prediction method’s accuracy. The synthetic data generation process involves creating signals, generating observations with mixing probabilities, shifting the observations, and adding noise. These experiments help evaluate the methods across various scenarios of cluster count (K) and noise level (σ).

Experiments for Clustering and Lead-lag Estimation
The paper outlines an experiment pipeline involving clustering, lead-lag estimation, and trading simulation, comparing four models. These models include S-Pairwise, S-Sync, S-IVFhomo, and I-IVFhet. The models are evaluated using metrics like Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for clustering and accuracy, directional error, and absolute error for lead-lag estimation.
The results show that Spectral Clustering (SPC) outperforms IVF-1NN clustering methods in terms of robustness against noise, particularly when noise levels are high. In lead-lag estimation, MRA-based models perform better than the pairwise estimation model, with the homogeneous IVF (IVFhomo) model showing the best performance. As the number of clusters (K) increases, the performance of all models decreases due to reduced average sample sizes within each class.
The heterogeneous IVF (IVFhet) model can struggle with limited samples, leading to less accurate results. However, these limitations can be mitigated by increasing sample sizes and optimizing initializations.

Application to Equity Trading
The paper presents a trading strategy designed to exploit the predictive power of leading stocks’ returns on lagging stocks’ returns. It maintains a long-short portfolio of constant investment size without reinvestment. The strategy is applied to both synthetic and real financial data.
In the synthetic data experiments, it is observed that better lead-lag detection generally leads to higher profits in trading, particularly when noise levels are high. The trading results demonstrate that the models based on matrix recovery algorithms (MRA) outperform the model based on pairwise estimation. The Sharpe Ratio (SR) is used to rank the models, with S-IVFhomo performing significantly better than the others.
In the real data backtesting, the trading strategy achieves profitability, especially in the years before 2010, with portfolio returns becoming more stable and showing slower growth after that period. The fluctuations in portfolio returns are smaller from 2010 to 2019. This suggests a potential decrease in lead-lag effects among daily stock returns during this period due to improved market efficiency. The paper suggests future research directions for investigating lead-lag structures at higher frequency levels, such as hourly and minutely data. The description of a study or experiment related to backtesting trading strategies using real stock data:

Data and Portfolios:
The study is based on real stock data.
It compares the performance of lead-lag models on dollar-neutral portfolios with the performance of a buy-and-hold portfolio of the SPY (a popular ETF tracking the S&P 500).

Portfolio Volumes:
The buy-and-hold portfolio maintains a constant volume of $100.
The long-short portfolios maintain a constant volume of $200. This is achieved by hedging the volume of trading laggard stocks with an equal volume of SPY.

Lead-Lag Model Parameters:
The lead-lag relationship is estimated using time series data with a length of 50.
The model is retrained every 10 trading days to account for changing lead-lag relationships.

Optimization:
Parameters K and σ are optimized for clustering and signal recovery based on in-sample Profit and Loss (PnL).
The optimization is done over specific ranges, with K values of 1, 2, and 3, and σ values ranging from 0.2 to 2.0.

Trading Signal Ranking:
The study ranks the trading signal-to-noise ratio (SR) for different models. The ranking is as follows: S-IVFhomo > S-Sync > S-pairwise > I-IVFhet, with S-IVFhomo being significantly better than the others.

Model Performance:
The study finds that MRA-based lead-lag models produce better trading profits compared to models based on pairwise estimation.
All models outperform the SPY portfolio in terms of the Sharpe Ratio (SR), which is a measure of risk-adjusted return.
The I-IVFhet model underperforms, which is attributed to weaker clustering power due to issues related to the parameters K and σ in the real data.

Signal Recovery:
Signal recovery is essential for clustering and lead-lag detection.
Inaccurate values of K (number of clusters) have a more significant impact on signal recovery than inaccurate σ (standard deviation).
The I-IVFhet model is noted for recovering non-representative signals, which are unhelpful for clustering and lead-lag detection.

Overall, the study suggests that the MRA-based lead-lag models, specifically S-IVFhomo, are more effective at generating trading profits than pairwise estimation models, with all models outperforming the simple buy-and-hold strategy represented by the SPY portfolio. The issues with the I-IVFhet model are attributed to suboptimal parameter choices.
