This paper explores the domain of earnings forecasting by introducing distributional forecasts, emphasizing the importance of viewing earnings as a probability distribution rather than relying on conventional point estimates. Recognizing that earnings play a pivotal role in stock recommendations, the paper employs advanced statistical machine learning techniques to estimate earnings distributions based on observable company fundamentals just before earnings announcements. It provides empirical evidence of the calibration of these distributional forecasts by demonstrating a close alignment between estimated distribution percentiles and realized earnings percentiles. Moreover, the paper underscores the potential for improved forecasting by rectifying the prevalent miscalibration in management and financial analyst range forecasts. For investors, the paper demonstrates the utility of distributional earnings forecasts by analyzing stock market reactions and reveals that trading strategies based on firms’ probabilities of beating or missing consensus analyst forecasts yield substantial abnormal returns. This research advocates considering the complete earnings distribution, rather than relying solely on point estimates, offering valuable insights for forecasting, management, analysts, and investors.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for functionality of this paper lies in its investigation into the derivation and application of distributional forecasts for earnings. The focal point on earnings is substantiated by extensive research revealing it as the paramount metric in assessing firm performance and shaping stock recommendations. The innovation introduced here stems from a prevalent reliance on point estimates in earnings forecasting, prevalent in financial analyst forecasts, management predictions, and various modeling techniques. This practice, while convenient, falls short of capturing the inherent uncertainty associated with future earnings, which inherently follow a probability distribution. By harnessing cutting-edge statistical machine learning techniques, this paper rectifies this limitation, providing well-calibrated distributional forecasts of earnings. These forecasts offer numerous advantages, from improving the accuracy of management and analyst predictions to enhancing investment strategies based on the probability of beating or missing consensus forecasts. Ultimately, this research underscores the advantages of embracing full earnings distributions over singular point estimates across various aspects of decision-making and analysis within the financial realm.

Simple trading strategy
The authors talk about the process of obtaining distributional forecasts for future earnings (Earn) based on a set of predictor variables (X). The objective is to estimate the predictive distribution, denoted as P(Earn | X), which represents the likelihood of different earnings outcomes given the predictor variables.

The definition of Earn is provided, and it’s calculated as the earnings per share divided by the stock price at the beginning of the quarter. The paper acknowledges that while summary statistics like the mean can be calculated from the predictive distribution, the actual predictive distribution is unknown and needs to be estimated. This estimation process constitutes the distributional forecast for future earnings.

To estimate this distribution, the paper discusses two approaches:
Parametric Approach: This involves assuming that the predictive distribution P(Earn | X) belongs to a specific parametric family (e.g., normal distribution) and then fitting the parameters of this distribution to the available data. However, this approach may be restrictive, as it assumes a specific shape for the distribution, which may not accurately capture the characteristics of earnings distributions.
Nonparametric Approach (BoXHED): Instead of making restrictive assumptions about the distribution’s shape, the paper employs a distributional machine learning approach called BoXHED. This approach, which is based on the BoXHED method developed by Lee et al. (2021), allows for a nonparametric estimation of the predictive distribution P(Earn | X). It avoids making strong assumptions about the shape of the distribution, making it more suitable for capturing the often ill-behaved characteristics of earnings distributions.

The predictor variables used in this analysis include a range of financial and market-related metrics, such as analyst forecasts, revenue, book-to-market ratio, cash flow, and more. These variables are used to predict the distribution of future earnings.
The data sample is obtained from various sources, including IBES for earnings and analyst forecast data, Compustat for accounting information, and CRSP for stock-related data. The sample includes firm-quarter observations from 2001 to 2021.
To validate the accuracy of the distributional forecasts, the paper employs probability calibration plots, which compare the predicted probabilities of earnings outcomes to the actual probabilities based on realized earnings data. The results show that the distributional forecasts are well-calibrated, indicating that they align closely with actual earnings outcomes. Additionally, the paper compares these distributional forecasts to benchmark fore.

Section 3 investigates the miscalibration in management and analyst earnings forecasts and introduces prediction ranges for future earnings.

Prediction Ranges for Future Earnings:
The paper discusses using distributional forecasts to establish prediction ranges for earnings, offering a degree of certainty. These ranges can indicate, for example, an 80% or 95% likelihood of earnings falling within a specific interval.

Imputing Coverage Probabilities of Management Forecasts:
It assesses coverage probabilities implied by management forecast ranges. These forecasts are often too narrow, underestimating earnings variability. On average, managers believe their forecasts have an 80% coverage, but the actual coverage is around 30%. There’s also substantial variation across firms.

Imputing Coverage Probabilities of Analysts’ Forecasts:
The analysis extends to analysts’ earnings forecasts, which exhibit better but still relatively low coverage. The median coverage probability is 46%, with considerable variation.

Stock trading strategies based on distributional forecasts of earnings, primarily focusing on publicly traded U.S.-listed common stocks.
The authors aim to capture investor reactions to firms meeting, beating, or missing analyst earnings expectations.

They create a measure based on our distributional forecasts, indicating the probability of firms beating or missing analyst earnings expectations by a specific margin (N cents per share). This measure is used to form trading portfolios: they take long positions in firms with high probabilities of beating expectations and short positions in firms with low probabilities.

Analyzing the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) for these portfolios around earnings announcements, they find that our trading strategy generates positive CAR. The strategy performs better for firms with higher probabilities of missing expectations.

The authors validate our approach by showing that the differential probability measure we use predicts actual earnings beats and misses. It also outperforms a strategy based on the mean of distributional forecasts.

Findings demonstrate the potential of using distributional forecasts for stock trading strategies, with a particular focus on investor reactions to earnings surprises. The distributional approach appears more effective than mean-based approaches in predicting and capitalizing on earnings surprises.
