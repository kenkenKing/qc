In recent years, text mining has emerged as a valuable tool for analyzing and predicting economic and financial events, utilizing a variety of text sources like news articles, regulatory filings, and social media posts. However, traditional methods, such as sentiment analysis using finance-specific dictionaries, have limitations due to their simplicity and inability to capture complex language structures. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome these limitations and offer a more sophisticated approach to financial text analysis. By employing state-of-the-art LLMs like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), and FinBERT, this study aims to assess their effectiveness in predicting stock market trends. The authors propose a methodology that converts financial texts into numerical representations for modeling stock returns, comparing LLM-based sentiment analysis with traditional dictionary approaches.

Fundamental reason
The strategy of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze financial texts for predicting economic and financial events is effective for several fundamental reasons. Financial texts like news articles, regulatory filings, and social media posts contain rich, complex information. Unlike numerical data, text data requires advanced models to understand context, word relationships, and semantic nuances. Traditional methods, such as dictionary-based sentiment analysis, often oversimplify text and miss important context, focusing primarily on term frequency. LLMs like BERT and OPT offer a more sophisticated approach by learning from diverse sources, allowing for more accurate interpretation of financial documents. These models can generate refined sentiment scores that can predict stock returns and market trends more effectively. By converting financial texts into numerical representations, LLMs enable improved modeling accuracy, reducing information loss that typically occurs with simpler methods. This strategy also has practical implications for trading. By using LLM-derived sentiment scores, investors can develop trading strategies, creating long, short, or long-short portfolios based on refined sentiment analysis. These strategies lead to better-informed investment decisions.

Data and methods
The authors use two key datasets: one from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), which includes daily stock returns, and another from Refinitiv, containing global financial news focused on U.S. companies. The CRSP data includes stock prices, trading volumes, and market capitalization, while the Refinitiv dataset provides detailed news articles and alerts.

The analysis covers January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023, and involves 2,732,845 news articles about 6,214 unique companies. The researchers apply filters to ensure quality, focusing on news associated with individual stocks, removing redundant articles based on cosine similarity scores (0.8 or higher), and ensuring each article has corresponding three-day returns data. After filtering, the final dataset comprises 965,375 unique news articles.

Descriptive statistics (Table 2) show that the mean daily stock return is 0.37%, with a standard deviation of 0.18%. Sentiment scores derived from the BERT, OPT, and FinBERT LLMs tend to be centered around a median of 0.5, while scores from the Loughran-McDonald dictionary are positively skewed with a mean of 0.68 and a higher standard deviation of 0.32. These statistics help to outline the key characteristics of the dataset used in the study.

The study fine-tunes pre-trained large language models (LLMs), namely BERT and OPT, for financial analysis, focusing on using sentiment from financial news to predict stock returns. These models, designed for general linguistic tasks, require customization to understand financial texts and forecast stock performance. The fine-tuning process involves adapting the models to identify financial-specific language patterns and trends that can signal stock market movements.

In addition to BERT and OPT, the study uses FinBERT, a BERT variant designed for financial contexts, and the Loughran and McDonald dictionary, a well-known finance-specific lexicon. FinBERT is pre-trained on financial texts, providing inherent suitability for financial sentiment analysis, while the Loughran and McDonald dictionary offers a conventional approach to assessing financial texts without complex machine learning models.

The fine-tuning of BERT and OPT revolves around a key metric: the aggregated 3-day excess return of stocks. This metric is derived by calculating the difference between a stock’s return and the market’s return on the same day, extended across a three-day period following the publication of a news article. A positive 3-day excess return indicates a positive sentiment, while a non-positive return indicates a negative sentiment. This approach aligns with financial event studies, allowing the analysis to focus on the impact of news on stock performance over a multi-day period.

To assess the effectiveness of these models, the study uses linear regression to evaluate how well sentiment scores predict stock returns. This regression includes fixed effects for firm and date, with double clustering for standard errors to address issues like heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. This method allows for direct comparison of OPT, BERT, FinBERT, and the Loughran-McDonald dictionary in predicting stock returns.

The study’s trading strategy development involves creating portfolios based on sentiment scores derived from these models. The long portfolios contain stocks with the highest 20% sentiment scores, while the short portfolios consist of stocks with the lowest 20%. The long-short portfolios, which are self-financing, involve taking long positions in high-sentiment stocks and short positions in low-sentiment stocks. These portfolios are updated daily to reflect changes in sentiment, with a 10 basis point transaction cost to simulate real-world trading expenses.

Trades are timed according to news releases to capture market responses accurately. News before 6 a.m. leads to trading at market opening, while news between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. prompts trades based on the closing price that day, with the position closed on the following day. News after 4 p.m. leads to trading at the start of the next trading day. This approach considers the real-world conditions of market operations, providing a practical framework for evaluating the performance of these trading strategies based on financial sentiment analysis.
