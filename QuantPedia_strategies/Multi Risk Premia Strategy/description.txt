According to the authors, from a strategic asset allocation perspective, single-risk premia strategies offer an effective way of tilting a portfolio, in the short term, towards a specific risk factor to profit from a particular view of the market opportunistically. However, such strategies carry a high concentration risk, with institutional investors often reverting to multi-risk premia strategies for longer-term allocation decisions. The fundamental principles outlined throughout our strategy descriptions serve as a guideline for SigTech’s risk premia strategies. In addition to applying a fully transparent methodology, they emphasize a sound underlying economic rationale, liquidity, and – perhaps most importantly – using as consistent a methodology as possible across our various strategies.  The strategies cover the liquid asset classes: commodities, fixed income, FX, and equities – distinguishing between equity index and equity single stock strategies. Focus is put on the most common risk premia: value, momentum, carry, and volatility, and a recently added tail risk strategy. While tail risk is not a traditional risk premia strategy, they chose to include it due to its historically attractive diversification properties during more considerable sell-offs and the increasing popularity of systematic tail risk strategies among institutional investors. We needed to have such very complex Multi-risk premia type of strategies in our encyclopedia, and we are delighted to present you this as one of the possible versions to implement for willing investors.

Fundamental reason
A key reason for allocating to multiple risk premia strategies is to profit from favorable diversification properties, which are detailed in the correlation matrix. 1. Carry: The underlying rationale of trade is that a high-yielding asset, as measured by, for instance, dividend yield or interest rates, outperforms a low-yielding one. In academia, research into carry has been heavily skewed to studying the impact on the currency markets. But in 2017, Pedersen et al. published their widely referenced paper ‘Carry,’ a comprehensive study of the carry premium across all liquid asset classes. 2. Momentum: These strategies bet on the continuation of a price trend. Their underlying rationale is found in behavioral finance, which studies the impact of psychology on the behavior of market participants and the ensuing effect on asset prices. Momentum may be as old as markets themselves. Its strategies have enjoyed strong standing within the investment community since the 1970s, despite not gaining widespread recognition in academic circles until the 1993 publication of work by Jegadeesh and Titman. 3. Tail risk, which is not a traditional risk premia strategy. By systematically seeking downside protection, tail risk strategies often take the opposite position to investors attempting to capture a volatility risk premium. Firstly, from a portfolio construction perspective, tail risk can offer valuable diversification effects, especially during large and sudden sell-offs. Secondly, tail risk is gaining popularity, with institutional investors increasingly allocating to these strategies. 4. Value: The economic rationale for these strategies is that an asset’s price reverts to a fair value (“mean reversion”). Assets trading below their fair value are expected to outperform as they revert to (and exceed) their mean. Overvalued assets are expected to underperform due to the same dynamics. Value investing is a well-established and highly-regarded approach to investing, successfully implemented by well-known and respected investors such as Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway), Joe Greenblatt (Gotham Funds), and Seth Klarman (Baupost). In quantitative investment, the formal framework for systematically capturing the value premium gained prominence only recently. 5. Volatility strategies seek to systematically harvest a premium from selling portfolio insurance to investors wanting to limit the impact of adverse market events. The systems are predominantly implemented using options and traditionally emerge from the belief that implied volatility will exceed realized volatility. The existence of the premia can be explained by investors’ loss aversion (i.e., losses hurt more than equivalent gains) and their tendency to overestimate the occurrence of more considerable sell-offs. A 2015 paper by Fallon et al. demonstrates the robustness of the volatility premium across a wide range of asset classes. The average correlation between the single strategies was 0.05, indicating that a multi-strategy approach allocating to a wide range of strategies is expected to result in an improved Sharpe ratio compared to the average single-risk premia strategy.

Simple trading strategy
The investment universe consists of: GSCI Proxy (24 sub-indices [incl. CO COMDTY, GC COMDTY]) (representing Commodities), 16 developed and nine emerging markets (Equity Index [for example, SPX, NK, SX5E] constituents), Equity Single Stocks are 500 largest US stocks by market capitalization, G10 government bond [futures] (for Fixed Income), G10 currencies (as FX).

Signals for:
– Carry risk premia strategies are roll yields and interest rates depending on the investment universe;
– Momentum is defined as the ‘12 less 1-month’ price momentum across all asset classes.
– Tail Risk; Buying three months 10% out-of-the-money puts.
– For Value, they are namely: Deviation from 3Y mean assuming mean reversion; Combined Z-scores based on: P/E, P/B, P/CF; Duration-weighted yield-to-maturity; and Ratio 5Y avg. FX rate to OECD PPP rate.
– Volatility by selling at-the-money straddles.

The SigTech multi-risk premia strategy applies an equal risk contribution methodology that accounts for volatility and correlation. To limit the impact of extreme values, a minimum and maximum weight to each individual risk premia strategy is applied.

Furthermore, a portfolio construction process of being long the top 25% and short the bottom 25% is applied for all strategies.

All portfolios (and the final one) are constructed as equal-weighted baskets and rebalanced quarterly.

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
Yes - Diversified multi-factor strategy usually has a very low correlation with equities, is a very good diversifier, and can probably be used very well as a hedge during bear markets.
