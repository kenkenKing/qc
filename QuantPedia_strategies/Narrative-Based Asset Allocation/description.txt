This paper explores the impact of narratives on financial markets and proposes incorporating narratives into economic theory for more accurate economic forecasting. Using textual analysis and natural language processing (NLP) on media articles, the paper quantifies attention and sentiment towards different narratives. It identifies the Market Crash narrative as having the highest explanatory power for US equity markets and demonstrates that media narratives can provide information for future market returns. The paper also proposes a narrative-based dynamic asset allocation strategy that outperforms traditional strategies and presents a portfolio construction methodology based on narrative exposure. An example of a COVID-19 recovery portfolio using narrative sensitivity shows significant returns, outperforming a portfolio based on actual COVID cases.

Key Findings of the paper:
1. Narratives derived from media coverage using textual analysis can explain market-wide moves.
2. Narrative-conscious strategies can improve asset allocation.
3. Investors can gain or hedge financial exposure to a narrative by constructing portfolios of
narrative-sensitive assets.

The paper argues that narratives, which have been recognized as important in humanities and social sciences, have been overlooked in economics. Recent advancements in technology allow for quantitative analysis of narratives in economic and financial contexts. The paper uses a novel dataset to construct narrative indicators, identifies narratives driving financial markets, proposes asset allocation strategies, and develops a methodology for constructing portfolios based on narratives. This builds upon previous research and highlights the importance of context in analyzing narratives.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of the strategy proposed in the paper is the recognition that narratives, which are intangible and hard to measure, play a significant role in influencing individual and collective economic behavior, including financial market outcomes. By quantifying narratives using textual analysis and natural language processing on media articles, the paper provides a systematic approach to incorporating narratives into economic and financial analysis. The identified narratives, such as the Market Crash narrative or the COVID-19 recovery narrative, are shown to have predictive power in explaining market returns and can serve as valuable indicators for investment decision-making. The strategy leverages these narrative indicators to improve asset allocation and portfolio construction, taking advantage of the information contained in media narratives to make informed investment choices. The demonstrated success of the strategy, as shown by the positive returns of the COVID-19 recovery portfolio, supports the fundamental premise that narratives are important drivers of financial markets and can be utilized for investment purposes.

Data Construction and Methodology.
The paper describes the methodology for collecting and analyzing articles from global digital media sources to identify narratives that can potentially impact financial markets. Over 150,000 articles are collected daily and tagged based on their general topic and the assets they cover. Articles are also tagged for relevancy to a predefined set of 73 narratives using proprietary algorithms. Sentiment scores are assigned to each article, adjusted for overall daily tone. The intensity of each narrative is measured as the proportion of articles relevant to that narrative relative to all articles collected, with negative intensity used as it captures directionality in addition to coverage amount. The paper presents examples of three narratives (market crash, trade war, and Brexit) and how their intensity tracks with relevant financial events over time. This real-time view of narratives allows for empirical study of the impact of narratives on financial markets and portfolio returns. See Exhibit 1.

Narratives and their influence on Market drive.
The essence of this part is that the authors of the paper have developed a framework to quantitatively analyze the impact of narratives derived from digital media on financial markets. They seek to answer questions such as which narratives are significant drivers of market movements. They construct a weekly intensity value for each narrative by averaging daily intensity values over the most recent seven days, including weekends. They then compute weekly changes in intensity and run regression analyses to determine the degree to which these changes explain aggregate market returns. The R2 values obtained from these regressions provide insight into the contemporaneous explanatory power of each narrative for market moves.

Top Narratives.
The authors have identified the top narratives that explain the largest degree of market moves by ranking narratives based on their average R2 values. They focus on US equity (SPY) and US currency (DXY) markets. They find that the narrative intensity of “Market Crash” has the highest average R2 value in equity markets, suggesting that investors are sensitive to risks associated with market drawdowns and adjust their portfolios accordingly. Regression analysis confirms a negative and significant relationship between negative intensity of “Market Crash” coverage and SPY returns, indicating that increased negative coverage of this narrative coincides with lower market returns. They also note that the top narrative drivers vary across markets, with different narratives being important for US Dollar (DXY) market, such as interest rates and policies set by the Federal Reserve and the White House. See Exhibit 2.

Topical Narratives.
The authors observed how different narratives emerged and rose to prominence over time, influenced by external events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and US elections, and how they impacted investor perceptions and decisions. They use Exhibit 4 to illustrate how the COVID-19 narrative gained attention in the media as the pandemic unfolded, and how it affected markets. They highlight that the risk of an impending recession due to the pandemic drove markets even more than the actual coverage of COVID-19 initially. As the pandemic outlook became bleaker, investors tracked COVID-19 related news more closely, as reduced mobility and quarantine orders were understood to have significant impacts on the economy. Panel C of Exhibit 4 presents regression analysis showing a significant negative relation between changes in negative coverage of the virus and contemporaneous SPY returns, indicating that negative coverage of COVID-19 was associated with lower market returns.

Predicting Market Returns
The authors demonstrate the quantifiable impact of narratives on market movements and explore whether media narratives can be used to forecast future market returns. The authors focus on the Market Crash narrative, which they found to be the top narrative for US equity markets. They conducted regression analysis and found that the Market Crash narrative contains predictive information for future market returns, even after controlling for traditional measures of market crash risk such as the VIX.They standardize the daily Market Crash intensity using a rolling 60-day window and obtain a daily z-score. The results show that a high coverage intensity of the Market Crash narrative with negative sentiment is associated with lower future stock returns, suggesting that a market-timing strategy that rotates out of equities when negative coverage on the Market Crash narrative is abnormally high may yield good performance. They identify instances of abnormally high negative coverage when the narrative z-score breaches the threshold of 3, and implement a rotation strategy out of equities into bonds for two weeks. The narrative-based strategy significantly outperforms other strategies, including a 50/50 equity/bond strategy, indicating that abnormally high media coverage of the Market Crash narrative can be useful in avoiding risk-off regimes.This paper demonstrates a portfolio construction methodology by which investors can select narrative-sensitive assets to achieve desired narrative exposure.
Portfolio construction.The authors estimate individual stock sensitivities to negative coverage of COVID-19 and construct a long-short portfolio by buying the 25 stocks with the lowest exposure measure (stock prices rise when negative coverage of COVID-19 decreases) and shorting the 25 stocks with the highest exposure measures (stock prices decrease when negative coverage of COVID-19 decreases). This narrative-beta based long short portfolio, dubbed COVID-19 recovery portfolio, had a negative return before Pfizer publicly announced that its COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective on November 9, 2020. However, it earned a return of 120.74% in the period from November 2020 to December 2021. This narrative-beta based portfolio tracks the COVID recovery much better than a similar long-short portfolio that instead uses the return sensitivity to the changes of actual COVID cases: the case-count beta sorted long-short portfolio does not show a similar upward trend after November 2020.

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
Yes - One of the paper’s key findings is that Investors can gain or hedge financial exposure to a narrative by constructing portfolios of narrative-sensitive assets. Selected stock(s) can be a hedge against the risk associated with the narrative.
