This paper explores the significance of contextual information in empirical asset pricing models. It emphasizes that numeric characteristics, such as earnings figures, need to be understood in the context of qualitative factors that are often overlooked. To address this, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates that companies provide narrative context alongside their reported numbers. The study focuses on operating profitability and aims to incorporate context into this metric. To achieve this, the researchers utilize BERT, a language model, to quantify the textual context surrounding operating performance. They then construct a context-based proxy for future operating profitability using neural networks. Their findings reveal that this context-adjusted measure outperforms conventional profitability proxies in predicting stock returns, even when used alongside them. The paper also explores the potential for improving asset pricing models by incorporating contextual information. It introduces a context-based profitability factor and compares it to traditional profitability factors. The results show that the context-based factor enhances the model’s ability to price securities and resolves a longstanding puzzle in empirical asset pricing. this paper highlights the importance of considering context when interpreting numeric characteristics in asset pricing models, introduces a method for incorporating context into metrics, and demonstrates the value of context-aware measures in improving the performance of these models.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of this paper lies in addressing a critical limitation in empirical asset pricing models. These models typically rely on numeric characteristics, such as earnings figures, without considering the qualitative context in which these numbers are reported. The paper recognizes that when two companies report identical earnings figures, their interpretation can vary significantly based on non-quantitative factors like changes in strategic goals, competition, production delays, and supply chain disruptions, among others. To mitigate this issue, the paper leverages the regulatory requirement by the SEC for companies to provide narrative context alongside their financial numbers. It explores the importance of context in asset pricing models and demonstrates that incorporating context significantly enhances the value of numeric characteristics. Notably, it shows that considering the context of profitability is particularly crucial, especially in addressing the challenges of pricing small stocks with extreme growth. The proposed strategy’s functionality lies in its ability to answer essential questions related to the role of contextual information in improving asset pricing models. It investigates whether contextual information offers opportunities to enhance these models, how interactions between numeric characteristics and context impact their effectiveness, and whether meaningful context-adjusted characteristics and factors can be constructed. To achieve these objectives, the paper focuses on the context of operating profitability captured in the MD&A section of annual reports. It quantifies the unstructured and multi-dimensional nature of narrative context using BERT, a language model, and constructs a context-based proxy for future operating profitability. This approach helps address the challenge of incorporating context into numeric metrics.

Simple trading strategy
The fundamental framework proposed by Fama and French in 2006 for understanding the relationship between expected stock returns and firm characteristics is described in Section 2. This framework revolves around a valuation equation that predicts how expected returns vary based on factors like the Bt/Mt ratio, expected future profits, and expected investments. The central idea is that higher expected profitability should lead to higher expected returns, controlling for other factors. While Fama and French found empirical support for these predictions, the economic impact of profitability and investment on stock returns appeared relatively modest.

The paper then introduces Novy-Marx’s pivotal contribution in 2013, where he emphasized the importance of focusing on the “true profitability” of firms rather than relying on accounting earnings (net income) as a proxy. Accounting earnings often contain transitory components and may not accurately reflect a company’s actual earnings potential. Novy-Marx advocated for Gross Profit as a more robust predictor of returns. Subsequent studies further refined these profitability proxies.

However, the paper highlights that existing research has primarily focused on quantitative adjustments to profitability proxies and has largely neglected the influence of “softer” factors and narrative context. It argues that understanding how narrative discussions can affect the interpretation of quantitative characteristics, like profitability, is essential. Contextual information, such as how a drop in profits is related to shifts in the competitive landscape, can significantly impact the interpretation of numeric profitability values and their implications for future stock returns.

To address this challenge, the paper introduces a novel approach involving machine learning and natural language processing. This approach leverages the BERT language model to encode narrative information related to operating performance. By combining this encoded text with numeric data in a regression model with neural network components, the study aims to refine the interpretation of operating profitability based on contextual cues. This innovative approach, referred to as context-based operating profitability (OPCN), promises to enrich our understanding of how context interacts with numeric characteristics in predicting stock returns.

Implementation and training methodology for extracting context information using BERT and designing a feedforward deep neural network:

1. Extracting Context Information with BERT
The proposed methodology extracts narrative information about profitability from the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections of annual reports. A keyword list is used to identify sentences that explicitly discuss profitability. For each firm-year, these identified sentences are processed using BERT, a large language model developed by Google. BERT is chosen for its ability to understand the meaning of words and the context in which they are used. The model processes these sentences and encodes them into 768-dimensional numeric vectors, capturing the textual information’s essence. Special characters, tabular information, and graphics are removed, while numeric information is replaced with placeholder tokens. Since BERT can process up to 512 tokens simultaneously, longer documents are divided into passages and processed independently, with the embeddings associated with the classification token (CLS) being averaged to aggregate information.

2. Design of Feedforward Deep Neural Network
The textual vectors obtained from BERT, denoted as “cit,” are used as input into a deep neural network. The network architecture consists of an input layer with 768 neurons, followed by three hidden layers with 256, 64, and 16 neurons, respectively, and an output layer with two neurons. The output layer generates the two structural parameters needed for the predictive regression. The network is trained based on root mean squared error (RMSE), aiming to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual profitability values. The ReLU activation function is applied to all neurons except those in the output layer. Training is conducted using a rolling window spanning four years, and out-of-sample forecasts are generated to ensure model generalization. Validation sets, dropout rates, and stopping criteria are employed to prevent overfitting, with Adam optimizer used for training.

This methodology results in the estimation of parameters necessary for constructing forecasts of future profitability, specifically, OPCN (context-based) and OPC (context-free), which are discussed in the paper.

Data
This study uses a dataset covering US-listed securities from 1995 to 2020, with a focus on firms that have valid Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections in their 10-K filings. Data on firm characteristics are drawn from Compustat, and stock returns are sourced from CRSP. The sample includes stocks traded on NYSE, Amex, or Nasdaq, excluding financial sector firms. Missing data for key variables, such as book value of equity and market value of equity, are handled through imputation methods. Operating profitability (OP) is computed as revenues minus various costs, and the book value of equity is determined using specific adjustments. The dataset is used for various regression and portfolio analyses, and context-based adjustments are applied to profitability measures to account for transitory variations. The data statistics reveal differences between raw and context-adjusted profitability measures, with the latter exhibiting lower variability.

Validating Context-Adjusted Profitability
The paper in section 5 validates three profitability measures using out-of-sample ordinary least squares regressions for predicting future operating profitability. The findings reveal that the context-adjusted profitability measure, OPCN, outperforms both the standard (unadjusted) profitability measure (OP) and a text-only proxy (OPC) in terms of predictive power. OPCN exhibits a coefficient close to unity, indicating strong predictive ability, and achieves the highest adjusted R² of 28.33%. When all three measures are combined in a regression analysis, OPCN remains highly significant, while OP and OPC lose significance, and the adjusted R² shows a marginal improvement. These results affirm the value of incorporating contextual information for improved predictive modeling and have implications for subsequent asset pricing tests.

Analysis of stock returns using Fama-MacBeth regressions and portfolio sorts, primarily focusing on two measures of profitability: operating profitability (OP) and context-adjusted profitability (OPCN). The analysis includes control variables such as past stock returns, market value of equity, book-to-market ratio, and investment. Some of the key findings:

Fama-MacBeth Regressions:
OP exhibits statistically significant predictive power for stock returns, with a coefficient of 0.91 and a t-value of 3.01.
Replacing OP with the text-based proxy OPC leads to an insignificant coefficient and a decrease in explanatory power.
In contrast, OPCN, the context-adjusted profitability measure, displays a strong predictive ability with a coefficient of 1.95 and a high t-value of 4.23. The adjusted R² also improves.
When comparing OP and OPCN simultaneously, OP loses significance, while OPCN remains statistically significant.
Including all three proxies in one regression, only OPCN remains significant, indicating its dominance.
Portfolio Sorts:

Context-adjusted profitability (OPCN) results in positive and statistically significant alphas for various asset pricing models, indicating its ability to predict stock returns.
Operating profitability (OP) also shows significant alphas, but these are generally lower than those associated with OPCN.
Two-way sorts on OP and OPCN demonstrate that context-adjusted profitability consistently outperforms operating profitability in predicting returns.

In section 7, a profitability factor based on context-adjusted profitability (RMWCN) is constructed and evaluated for its ability to price assets. The analysis involves several tests and comparisons with conventional factors:

Independent Sorts: Stocks are sorted into portfolios based on market capitalization and context-adjusted profitability. The factor return is calculated as the difference between high and low portfolios. RMWCN exhibits a higher annualized return and standard deviation compared to RMW, with the highest Sharpe ratio.

Correlations: RMW and RMWCN are positively correlated but not identical, indicating that context-based information affects their relations with other factors.

Spanning Tests: RMWCN, when combined with other factors, fully prices RMW, while the reverse is not true. RMWCN captures additional information not reflected by the conventional five factors.

Pricing of Portfolios: When assessing profitability-based portfolios, RMW fails to generate statistically significant returns, while RMWCN consistently generates positive alphas. Replacing RMW with RMWCN in the model improves the pricing of profitability-based portfolios.

Pricing of Problematic Portfolios: RMWCN significantly improves the performance of asset pricing models in pricing problematic portfolios, particularly those consisting of small stocks with low profitability.

Ex Post Maximum Sharpe Ratio: Incorporating RMWCN into the investment strategy leads to a substantial increase in the Sharpe ratio, indicating improved mean-variance efficiency in portfolio selection.

The analysis demonstrates that incorporating context-adjusted profitability through RMWCN enhances the ability to price assets and improve investment strategies compared to conventional models like the Fama-French five-factor model. This suggests that context-based adjustments provide valuable information for asset pricing and portfolio management.
