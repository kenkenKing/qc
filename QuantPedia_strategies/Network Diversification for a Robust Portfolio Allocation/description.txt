Financial markets are complex and interconnected, making diversification crucial for investors. Risk parity and momentum strategies are popular approaches to portfolio allocation. However, combining these strategies can lead to sudden jumps and overexposure to related assets. In this paper, a new approach is proposed using correlation networks to enhance diversification. The centrality of an asset in the network is related to its contribution to diversification. This strategy avoids reliance on optimization algorithms and can be applied to long-short portfolios. Generalizing the approach to multiplex networks allows for encoding non-linear relationships among assets. Multiplex-diversification strategies provide a comprehensive framework to address different market behaviors and limit risk exposure beyond linear correlations.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of the proposed stock ranking approach using a random forest classification model is to address the challenge faced by asset managers in picking stocks that outperform in the future. Traditional prediction models based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis have shown limited success in accurately predicting future stock price movements. However, with the advancements in computational power, researchers have turned to machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines, deep learning, and ensemble models, which have demonstrated promising results in predicting short-term stock price trends. The proposed random forest classification model leverages the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to capture non-linear patterns and identify anomalies in stock behavior, potentially leading to improved stock ranking and selection. By calculating outperformance probabilities based on the classification results of multiple decision trees, the model aims to provide risk-averse investors with portfolios that contain less volatile stocks while still achieving significant outperformance. The functionality of this approach is supported by the evaluation of performance using a dataset of liquid stocks, which demonstrates highly significant alphas and the ability to construct mean-variance portfolios that outperform in out-of-sample tests. Overall, the functionality of the proposed model contributes to the literature by offering an alternative approach to stock ranking and selection, leveraging machine learning techniques to identify potential outperforming stocks and improve investment strategies.

Diversification and Networks
Diversification is crucial for portfolios and investment strategies. Risk parity strategies allocate assets to control risk exposure and distribute it equally among components or asset classes. Correlation matrices measure interconnections between assets based on their returns but estimating them accurately is challenging. Networks offer a simplified representation of asset interactions, providing a more stable perspective. By representing correlations as a network, we can identify important connections while maintaining network sparsity.
1. Networks
A network is a graph composed of vertices (assets) and edges (connections) between them. The authors assign weights to the edges to measure the strength of the connections. In their analysis, we use three dissimilarity measures to define the weights. The first measure is based on the Gower distance using the Pearson correlation coefficient, which captures linear relationships between assets. The second measure utilizes the Gower distance with the Kendall tau rank distance, which measures ordinal associations. The third measure is the lower tail dependence coefficient, which is important for robust diversification during market stress. They use an estimator for this coefficient. The weight assignment and analysis of these measures provide insights into asset interconnections and diversification.
1.1 Minimum Spanning Tree
The minimum spanning tree (MST) is a graph filtering technique that connects all vertices while minimizing the total distance. It reduces the number of edges from N(N-1)/2 to N-1, retaining only the most important edges. The MST reveals a hierarchical organization among assets and has been linked to financial theory. Kruskal’s algorithm is commonly used to determine the minimum spanning tree by adding the lowest-weight edges that do not form cycles until all vertices are connected. The MST and its related hierarchical clustering tree have been utilized in innovative allocation methods such as hierarchical risk parity. Illustration of a minimum spanning tree for the long-only portfolio can be found in Figure 1.
1.2 Planar Maximally Filtered Graph
The planar maximally filtered graph (PMFG) is a filtered graph that connects all assets and retains more information than the minimum spanning tree (MST). It is a planar graph with N vertices and 3N – 6 edges, including cliques that represent highly related groups of assets. The PMFG maintains the hierarchical organization of the MST while incorporating cliques. It is extracted using the algorithm of Boyer and Myrvold. For large asset numbers, the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG) can be used as a faster and scalable alternative, providing an approximate solution to the weighted maximum planar graph problem. Illustration of a planar maximally filtered graph can be found in Figure 2.
1.3 Multiplex Network
A network captures only one aspect of the relationship between vertices, but sometimes it’s desirable to encode multiple aspects simultaneously. Multiplex networks, introduced by Goffman in 1974, allow for the representation of different levels of information in each layer while sharing the same vertices. Musmeci et al. used a multiplex approach to study financial networks during stress periods, constructing a 4-layer network based on different correlations. In this work, we utilize a 3-layer multiplex network consisting of planar maximally filtered graphs, where each layer represents Pearson correlation, Kendall correlation, and lower tail dependence of assets. This unified representation encodes multiple perspectives on the portfolio, enhancing diversification during financial stress and reducing contagion.

Network Measures
The network structure provides valuable insights into the role of each asset within the portfolio. Network Science offers quantitative measures to capture this importance, focusing on both the vertices (assets) and their connections (edges). These measures assess various aspects of vertex importance within the network. The goal is to translate the network structure into investment decisions. Network measures can be categorized into two classes: those based solely on the network structure and those incorporating additional information such as weights. Measures relying on topological information are model agnostic, allowing for straightforward combination and comparison across different networks, including multiplex networks.

Network-based Allocation Concepts
The network structure can be leveraged to enhance investment decisions and portfolio allocation. Previous research and practical applications have demonstrated the potential of network-based approaches.
1. Inverse Degree Centrality Portfolio
The network-based allocation concepts utilize the interconnections between portfolio components. The naïve risk-parity portfolio (NRP) allocates weights based on asset volatility, while the inverse degree centrality portfolio (IDCP) considers both volatility and the asset’s centrality in the network. IDCP favors less connected assets and aims for a well-diversified portfolio by penalizing highly central assets.
2. Inverse Eigenvector Centrality Portfolio
The portfolio weights can also be determined using eigenvector centrality in a given network. The eigenvector centrality portfolio (IECP) multiplies the NRP weights with the inverse eigenvector centrality, prioritizing peripheral assets for diversification. Eigenvector centrality is important as it relates to the Effective Number of uncorrelated Bets (ENB), which measures risk contribution from independent factors in a portfolio. The correlation network and its eigenvector centrality help identify the riskiest uncorrelated factor for scaled asset returns.

The dataset and the strategies
Network-based allocation methods are examined in the context of a long-only multi-asset portfolio denoted in USD. The performance of these methods is compared against various industry benchmarks, including equal weighting (EW), naïve risk-parity (NRP), equal risk contribution (ERC), minimum variance portfolio (MVP), most diversified portfolio (MDP), and hierarchical risk parity (HRP).

The long-only multi-asset portfolio is composed of listed futures markets from commodities, equities, and fixed income asset classes. This portfolio aims to be representative and well-diversified, covering liquid and cost-efficient instruments. The futures contracts allow for dynamic leverage and target a specific volatility. The portfolio weights are calculated using different allocation methods and are rebalanced monthly. The target volatility of 5% is achieved by leveraging the portfolio on a daily basis. Historical returns are used to forecast the portfolio volatility, considering both 20 and 90 business days. Transaction costs are incorporated realistically by charging 1 future tick for position changes or contract rollovers. Table 1 shows the listed futures used for the long-only multi-asset portfolio.

The allocation methods
Traditional portfolio allocation techniques can be divided into two categories: simple approaches and complex approaches. Simple approaches, such as equal weights (EW) and naïve risk-parity (NRP), ignore the correlation between assets and allocate weights evenly or based on volatility alone. Complex approaches, such as minimum variance (MV), most diversified portfolio (MDP), and equally-weighted risk contribution (ERC), rely on forecasting the covariance matrix and performing calculations involving its inversion. However, these complex methods often suffer from numerical instabilities and noise, leading to poor performance in out-of-sample scenarios.
To address these limitations, recent approaches like hierarchical risk parity (HRP) have emerged. HRP aims to uncover the hierarchical structure within a portfolio and leverages this structure to construct a robust allocation strategy. In this study, the network-based allocation methods are benchmarked against these traditional allocation techniques to assess their effectiveness.
