The substantial potential of the ORB (Opening Range Breakout) strategy is highlighted, especially when applied to Stocks in Play exhibiting a high Relative Volume of at least 100%. The findings of (Zarattini, Barbon, Aziz, 2024) underscore the strategy’s effectiveness in generating consistent and uncorrelated returns, thereby addressing the long-standing debate about the feasibility of day trading as a sustainable income source. The critical role is in selecting stocks with substantial trading activity, driven by underlying fundamental news, to capitalize on intraday volatility and liquidity. 5-minute ORB strategy with Relative Volume creating a portfolio engaged in day trading both long and short positions of U.S. stocks made it the newest addition to our trading database.

Fundamental reason
The presented paper contributes to the body of financial literature by providing a detailed, stock-specific analysis of ORB performance across different time frames, a first of its kind with such intraday granularity. A comprehensive analysis of the ORB strategy in the US equity market offers significant insights into its profitability and viability as a day trading approach. The remarkable performance of the 5-minute ORB strategy, in particular, stands out, demonstrating a notable advantage over longer time frames within the ORB strategy and a passive buy-and-hold approach. This strategy achieved a net performance of over 1,600%, with a Sharpe ratio of 2.81 and an annualized alpha of 36%, significantly outperforming the passive S&P 500 return of 198% over the same period. The superior performance of the 5-minute ORB suggests a unique dynamic at play in the earliest phases of the trading day, highlighting an area ripe for further exploration. Further investigation into the reasons behind the 5-minute ORB’s exceptional performance and exploration of additional variables that may influence the strategy’s success will be one of the future courses of work to be done.

As for coarse selection, these must be obeyed to enter a trade:
1. The opening price is to be above $5.
2. The average trading volume over the previous 14 days must be at least 1,000,000
daily shares.
3. The ATR over the previous 14 days was more than $0.50.
4. An additional constraint for the selected strategy variant: exclusively focus on those stocks whose Relative Volume is at least 100% and pick the top 20 stocks experiencing the highest Relative Volume.

Strategy conditions: The direction of each trade (long or short) is determined by the initial movement of the opening range. A positive opening range prompted a stop buy order, whereas a negative one led to a stop sell order. Then, there are 2 outcomes:
Set a stop loss at 10% of the ATR for every position opened.
If a position is not stopped during the day, wound at the end of the trading day.

This is an intraday trading strategy consisting of equally-weighting 20 stocks every day.
