This paper revisits the maximally predictable portfolio (MPP) problem initially proposed by Lo and MacKinlay (1997). The MPP aims to maximize the portion of portfolio return variability explained by its conditional expectation. Traditionally, MPP is derived as the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of a specific matrix product, given minimal constraints. However, this approach becomes complex with realistic constraints. The paper details an efficient algorithm by Gotoh and Fujisawa (2012) for computing optimal MPP weights under practical constraints, using return forecasts from machine learning models to identify the most predictable assets. Empirical analysis on S&P 500 index constituents shows that two types of MPP-based portfolios consistently outperform the index: one that scales top decile sorted returns by MPP weights, and another that combines MPP with a risk-free asset. The paper is structured as follows: literature review (Section 2), portfolio optimization methodology (Section 3), empirical results (Section 4), and conclusions (Section 5).

Fundamental reason
The functionality of this paper is rooted in its innovative approach to solving the maximally predictable portfolio (MPP) problem under realistic constraints, leveraging advanced techniques for portfolio optimization. By revisiting the MPP problem and employing an efficient algorithm by Gotoh and Fujisawa (2012), the strategy in this paper effectively computes optimal portfolio weights even when practical constraints are imposed, making the solution feasible for real-world applications. The integration of return forecasts from various machine learning models is a critical component, enhancing the ability to identify the most predictable assets. This data-driven approach allows for more accurate predictions and improved portfolio performance. The methodology is empirically validated using S&P 500 index constituents, providing substantial real-world evidence of its effectiveness. The results demonstrate that MPP-based portfolios consistently outperform the index, reinforcing the practical utility of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper addresses varying market conditions by constructing portfolios that focus on the most predictable assets and employing strategies like reward-risk timing with a risk-free asset. This adaptability contributes to more robust and resilient portfolio performance. Furthermore, the MPP concept, rooted in maximizing the explained variability in portfolio returns, provides a strong theoretical foundation. The use of eigenvector computation based on covariance matrices adds mathematical rigor to the optimization process. Together, these elements ensure that the paper’s methodology for maximizing portfolio predictability under realistic constraints is both functional and effective.

In section 3: Methodology, the authors detail the methodology used to compute the weights for a portfolio that maximizes predictability, employing a series of convex optimization problems. The process leverages the covariance matrix of predicted stock return errors from machine learning models as a key input in the objective function. Monthly, they estimated the weights to enhance portfolio return predictability, forming long-short and market-timing portfolios based on these weights. Separate machine learning models predict individual stock volatilities, essential for market-timing portfolios.
The initial dataset spans from 1962 to 1969, and it is used to train the models, while the strategies are validated on out-of-sample data from 1970 to April 1990. This validation process involves shifting the training data forward by one year every 12 months, continually refitting the models. The authors maintain multiple models for each hyperparameter combination, selecting the one with the highest out-of-sample predictive accuracy. The models’ final performance is evaluated using a holdout set from May 1990 to April 2020, providing a realistic estimate of their performance and avoiding backtest-overfitting.

This strategy focuses on timing the Most Predictable Portfolio (MPP) by leveraging its expected return and risk. Utilizing return forecasts from various models enhances the predictability of the MPP. The MPP’s expected return is calculated from the weighted sum of individual stock forecasts, and its monthly volatility is also predicted.

Allocation between the MPP and a risk-free asset is performed using a method similar to the one proposed by Pinelis and Ruppert (2020). This approach determines the optimal weight of the MPP in the overall portfolio, considering the investor’s risk aversion.

Long-Short Portfolios
This section explores constructing long-short portfolios to exploit varying predictability across stocks as forecasted by machine learning models.

Portfolio Construction
At the end of each month, one-month-ahead out-of-sample stock return predictions are calculated. Stocks are then sorted into deciles based on these forecasts. Portfolios are reconstituted monthly using both equal weights and the MPP’s weights.

Long-Short Strategy
A zero-net-investment portfolio is constructed by buying stocks with the highest expected returns (decile 10) and selling those with the lowest (decile 1). Two sets of long-short portfolios are created: one with equal weights and one with MPP weights. The MPP-weighted long-short portfolio is akin to a Kelly strategy (Kelly, 1956), where weights are proportional to the probability of a successful bet. Stocks with the highest expected returns and highest forecasting confidence receive the highest weights. If the probabilities are accurate, the MPP-weighted long-short portfolio should outperform the equal-weighted portfolio over time. In essence, the weights reflect confidence in the forecasts.

Data Overview
This study utilizes monthly data from several sources, including the CRSP database for stock prices, volume, and shares outstanding, and Compustat for fundamental company data. Historical risk-free rates are obtained from Kenneth French’s website. The merged CRSP/Compustat database provides stock returns and identifies stocks in the S&P 500 index each month.

From this data, fifteen fundamental features are formed, drawn from those identified by Gu et al. (2020) as most important for forecasting. These include various momentum measures, market capitalization, return volatility, sales-to-price, share turnover, price-to-earnings, book-to-market, and operating margin. Additionally, realized monthly lagged volatility is included in the stock volatility models.
