This paper deals with the world of quantitative hedge funds, which have experienced explosive growth and manage trillions of dollars in assets. These funds use machine learning techniques to make intraday trading decisions, a field that remains largely opaque to academic research due to its proprietary nature. The study sets out to answer critical questions regarding intraday stock return predictability and its economic implications. It seeks to understand the extent of intraday predictability, assess its economic profitability, and determine the most effective models for maximizing profits. Additionally, the paper explores the economic sources of intraday stock predictability.

Fundamental reason
The described strategy’s fundamental functionality centers around harnessing intraday stock predictability using machine learning techniques within quantitative hedge funds. This strategy capitalizes on the systematic and prevalent predictability of intraday stock returns across various market segments and individual stocks at different time intervals. It aims to achieve economic profitability by making trading decisions based on model forecasts, even after accounting for transaction costs, with profitability generally decreasing as the trading time horizon lengthens. The selection of machine learning models plays a crucial role, with nonlinear models often outperforming linear models, highlighting the importance of model complexity in capturing intraday predictability. Additionally, the strategy considers factors such as the impact of slow-moving capital within the trading day, the predictability patterns related to stock liquidity and trading activity, and the influence of different stock characteristics on intraday predictability. This comprehensive approach bridges the gap between longer-term and high-frequency trading strategies, offering insights into intraday stock return predictability and its economic significance.

Simple trading strategy
The methodology used in this study aims to evaluate the predictability of stock returns at various intraday time intervals. To do this, the research relies on a large dataset of intraday transaction data spanning from February 2004 to October 2016 (TAQ, NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ), including information on stock portfolios like the S&P 500 and its constituent stocks. The predictors for stock returns are based on lagged returns of these portfolios, creating a multitude of covariates. Various linear and nonlinear machine learning models are employed for modeling the relationship between these predictors and expected stock returns. The models include linear methods such as autoregressive (AR1) and penalized regression (e.g., ridge and lasso), as well as nonlinear methods like random forests, gradient-boosted regression trees, and neural networks with different numbers of hidden layers. The research utilizes a rolling window approach for model estimation, using training, validation, and test sets that shift forward by one month in each iteration to encompass a total of 142 months. Additionally, the study assesses variable importance by measuring the impact of different firm characteristics on the reduction in statistical predictability, utilizing Fama-MacBeth regressions and standardization techniques for interpretability.
The empirical results of the study are presented for market and sector portfolios across different intraday time horizons, examining both statistical predictability and economic significance, considering transaction costs. The out-of-sample predictive power reveals that linear models exhibit high R2 values, with penalized linear models such as OLS, LAS, RID, and EN performing well, while nonlinear models like RF, GBT, and NN1-NN5 generally have lower R2 values. Interestingly, linear models excel in statistical predictability. The economic significance, assessed before transaction costs, showcases that many models, except AR1, outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in terms of Sharpe ratios, indicating their economic viability. However, when transaction costs are incorporated, nonlinear models prove superior to linear models, maintaining high Sharpe ratios and delivering substantial returns. The analysis includes a scrutiny of alpha and risk factors, revealing statistically significant alphas, low risk factor betas, and low adjusted R2 values, suggesting that machine learning-based intraday trading strategies offer promising risk-adjusted returns, especially when transaction costs are considered. In conclusion, the study underscores the potential of machine learning models to generate economically significant returns in the field of intraday trading, with nonlinear models exhibiting superior performance in practice compared to linear models, despite their lower statistical predictive power.
The empirical results for individual S&P 500 constituent stocks at various intraday time horizons are evaluated. The study compares different machine learning techniques in terms of their out-of-sample R2 values and annualized Sharpe ratios, both before and after accounting for transaction costs. The findings indicate that penalized linear models, such as LAS and EN, generally outperform nonlinear models in terms of R2 values, and the predictability of individual stocks decreases as the time horizon increases. When assessing the economic significance of trading, it is evident that nonlinear models tend to outperform linear models, with long-short portfolios demonstrating positive and substantial Sharpe ratios, particularly when considering the 1-minute horizon. The study also introduces a new set of intraday portfolios constructed from individual stocks’ machine learning forecasts. These portfolios achieve significant returns before transaction costs. However, when transaction costs are taken into account, it is observed that nonlinear models, particularly those employing neural networks, are better suited for constructing profitable portfolios. This aligns with the theoretical framework suggesting that model complexity is crucial for achieving economic significance in intraday trading. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of machine learning models for intraday trading strategies on individual stocks, especially when complexity and transaction costs are considered.
Economic sources of predictability
This section delves into the economic factors driving intraday predictability in individual stocks. It observes time-of-day patterns, revealing that predictability peaks in the middle of the trading day. It also explores how stock characteristics impact predictability, finding that smaller, less liquid stocks are more predictable, while those with higher systematic risk show greater predictability. Additionally, liquidity variables, like firm size and trading volume, play a key role. These findings emphasize the role of slow-moving capital and provide insights into constructing profitable intraday trading strategies.
