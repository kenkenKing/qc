This paper discusses the concept of pairs trading, which involves taking opposing positions in two related risky securities based on statistical assessments. The goal of pairs trading is to profit from temporary divergences between the prices of the two securities, with the assumption that they will eventually return to an equilibrium level. Pairs trading has been a profitable strategy in the past, but its performance has declined in recent years.

The authors discuss two common methods for selecting pairs in pairs trading, namely the minimum distance method and the cointegration method. The minimum distance method is based on capturing the statistical relation between two securities with similar pay-off profiles, while the cointegration method involves evaluating the existence of a long-run relationship between two securities using cointegration tests. The paper notes that these methods have been used as benchmarks in pairs trading literature. The authors further mention that studies have shown declining returns in pairs trading, especially after accounting for transaction costs. Some studies have reported positive returns, while others have reported declining or variable returns. The paper suggests that the level of returns in pairs trading depends on a model’s ability to extract relevant information from noisy stock returns, and that filtering out noise can lead to better pairs and more successful trades. Wavelet filters are mentioned as a common method used for noise reduction in financial data analysis.

The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of addressing noisy data and considering the impact of noise on pairs trading strategies. It suggests that wavelet filtering can improve earnings in pairs trading and help identify better pairs for trading.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for the functionality of this strategy lies in its ability to address the declining performance of pairs trading strategies in the presence of noisy data and provide a potential solution through the use of wavelet filters. The paper builds on the existing literature on pairs trading and utilizes two commonly utilized pairs selection methods, namely the minimum distance method and the cointegration method, as benchmarks.

The paper identifies that noisy data can be detrimental to the predictability of financial assets and can lead to declining performance of pairs trading strategies. It highlights that the presence of market-wide noise can pollute the identification of co-moving pairs of securities, as the common noise may be mistaken for common movement. Therefore, filtering out the noise becomes crucial in identifying more successful pairs for trading.

The paper introduces the use of wavelet filters, which are frequently utilized for noise reduction in finance literature, to separate out the relevant information from the noisy stock returns. The wavelet filters are applied to the price data of the securities to filter out the common noise and reveal the underlying patterns and movements. This allows for a more accurate identification of pairs with potential for profitable trading. The paper shows that filtering the price data with wavelet transforms improves the earnings substantially, indicating that the use of wavelet filters can enhance the functionality of pairs trading strategies.The paper also addresses the issue of non-stationarity and irregularities in financial series, which are not effectively captured by traditional frequency-domain decomposition methods like Fourier transform. It suggests that wavelet filters can better reveal these non-stationary effects in financial data, leading to improved performance of pairs trading strategies. Overall, the fundamental reason for the functionality of this paper is its ability to identify the limitations of existing pairs trading strategies in the presence of noisy data, propose a potential solution using wavelet filters, and provide empirical evidence to support its findings. The use of wavelet filters helps in filtering out noise, revealing underlying patterns, and enhancing the performance of pairs trading strategies, which can be valuable for practitioners and researchers in the field of quantitative finance.

Simple trading strategy
The authors used two methods:
1. The Minimum Distance Method
The distance method is a commonly used technique for selecting pairs of stocks in pairs trading strategies. It involves calculating the average squared deviation of normalized prices for each stock, and then constructing a mean squared distance between pairs of stocks. The pairs are sorted based on this distance in ascending order to create a pairs list, and a subset of top pairs are selected for further analysis. This method is applied during a training (in-sample) period to determine pairs for trading in a subsequent trading (out-of-sample) period. The paper considers 1000 pairs from the top of the list for analysis, but results for smaller quantities of pairs are also available upon request from the authors.
2. The Cointegration Method
The cointegration method is another commonly used technique in pairs trading, which involves assessing the long-run equilibrium relationship between two stocks. The relationship between the stocks is modeled using a linear regression equation with error term, where the parameters are estimated through cointegration regression. If the price series of two stocks are integrated of order one I(1), and the error term is stationary I(0), indicating cointegration, it implies that the stocks move together in equilibrium. The spread between the stocks is considered a mean-reverting process, and temporary deviations from the long-run mean can be exploited for profitable trading strategies. The Johansen test is used to confirm the presence of cointegration between the pairs of stocks, and the optimal lag length is determined using Schwarz Information Criterion. The cointegration tests are conducted at a 5% significance level, and pairs with significant cointegration are selected for further analysis. For this study, the authors consider all possible cointegrated pairs among the constituents of S&P 500. The details on the number of pairs selected are reported in Subsection 5.1.

Wavelet Transform
Wavelet transform is a time-frequency domain filtering method that decomposes time series into low-frequency and high-frequency components, revealing the long-run and short-run properties of the data. Capturing the time-series properties of price series under different frequency domains allows us to establish profitable trading strategies by relying on the trend component rather than the noise component. The authors outline the wavelet techniques used in the analysis, providing a simpler exposition for ease of understanding, and also provide an example of applying wavelet transforms to pairs trading in Subsection 4.4.
The Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform
The use of discrete wavelet decomposition in this strategy is specifically the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT), as a framework for analyzing economic/financial data sampled in discrete intervals. The MODWT is preferred over the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) due to its ability to avoid sample size loss through down-sampling, which is not desirable for real-time trading signal series. The paper also mentions signal extension techniques such as zero padding and symmetric padding to address the requirement of dyadic sample size for MODWT, which may be too restrictive for financial time series. The essence of the application lies in using high-pass and low-pass filters to model short-run and long-run fluctuations, respectively. The paper also discusses the choice of filter types and filter length, which determine the degree of polynomial fitted for extracting information from time-series data. In the study, Level 1 approximation is used due to computational power concerns, but still yields strong results.

Data and Trading Rules
The data consist of the constituents of S&P 500 for the period that extends between March 5th, 2010 and March 15th, 2018. The authors divided this time period into eight equal financial years. Each year contains 252 days, excluding holidays and non-business days. The starting period is selected as the year 2010 to avoid the effect of the recent global financial crisis on the dataset. A detailed demonstration of the data split can be found in Table 1. The authors obtained the data from the Bloomberg terminal. It is composed of the stock prices that are adjusted for dividends and splits. The authors considered 415 stocks because only these stocks were traded in two consecutive years, which is required for appropriate pairs trading. Some basic statistics regarding the returns obtained from the constituents of the data are provided in Table 2.

Formation and Trading Periods
This part discussed the methodology for selecting and trading pairs of stocks using cointegration and minimum distance methods. The training period, consisting of 252 daily observations, is used for pairs selection, while the trading period, also consisting of 252 daily observations, is used for actual trading. The spread between the wavelet transformed stock price series is used as a signal for opening and closing positions in pairs. The authors emphasize the benefits of using a longer trading period and wavelet transformation to increase the robustness of their findings. Different spread specifications are used for trade initiation under different methods, including the use of original price series for cointegration method and wavelet transformed coefficients for wavelet spread. The differences in coefficient estimates are shown to play a key role in improving returns, and the issue of spurious relations among non-stationary series is addressed through conducting a large number of trials.

Threshold Selection & Trading Strategy
In pairs trading, a trading signal is initiated when the estimated spread between two stocks exceeds a predetermined threshold. The threshold is determined based on the standard deviation of the spread during a training period. The trading is initiated if the absolute value of the spread exceeds two historical standard deviations. This approach is similar to previous studies, but instead of endogenously determining the thresholds based on an objective function and mathematical assumptions, the authors straightforwardly compute the thresholds using the variability of in-sample spread values. The trading strategy involves shorting one dollar of one stock and longing β dollars of another stock when the spread exceeds the upper threshold, and vice versa when the spread is below the lower threshold. The authors also mention that their approach is slightly modified for ease of return calculations. Additionally, they do not initiate any pairs trade when the spread is between the lower and upper thresholds, and positions are closed when the spread becomes zero or changes sign after the trade is initiated. Mean returns are calculated from values obtained one day after the opening and closing signals, and any open positions at the end of the trading period are automatically closed.
In section 4.4 can be found the example of Pair Trade:
The example shows an application of concepts introduced in the previous strategy description, using data from Oneok and Estee Lauder stocks. Figure 2 shows the evolution of spreads and threshold values computed using both standard and sym22 wavelet filter approaches. The spreads are calculated using price data from a specific trading period, while the estimates and threshold values are based on a training period prior to that. Trade opening and closing times are denoted by vertical lines in different colors for wavelet-filtered and standard series. The paper mentions that the wavelet spread leads to more profitable trades with fewer losses compared to the standard approach. Figure 3 shows the resultant returns for the pair under both approaches, indicating that trading with the wavelet spread is more profitable due to more trades and natural closing after crossing the “zero” threshold.

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
No - The reviewed data time frame does not select data before the year 2010 to prevent the effect of the 2008/09 global financial crisis. The starting period is selected as the the year 2010 to avoid the impact of the recent global financial crisis on the dataset.
