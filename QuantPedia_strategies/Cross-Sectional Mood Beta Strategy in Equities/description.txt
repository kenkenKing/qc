According to the authors, there is a variety of intense, novel cross-sectional mood recurrence and reversal effects across calendar months and weekdays. We select two strategies from this fruitful research paper. The first one revolves around the role of mood beta, which measures a security’s return sensitivity to market-wide mood-induced mispricing in integrating mood recurrence and reversal effects. Across the board, we observe that high-mood beta stocks outperform during future ascending mood periods and underperform during future descending mood periods. Moreover, mood beta’s predictive power is incremental to market beta, sentiment beta, and a host of firm characteristics. Finally, with four months in a year totally invested, it provides an excellent risk-to-reward ratio and frees up capital for other great trading opportunities.

Fundamental reason
A mood seasonality hypothesis asserts that seasonal variations in investor mood are partly responsible for both aggregate and cross-sectional return seasonalities. Still, how to reconcile these findings with a rational risk-based story needs to be clarified in which predictable, seasonal cross-sectional returns require either seasonal, negative risk premiums or seasonal reversals in the cross-section of market betas or factor loadings. Existing literature suggests that aggregate and cross-sectional return seasonalities manifest seasonal shifts in factor premia—though not necessarily rational risk premia. The authors’ contribution and the strong remark is to one source of such seasonal factor return predictability: that seasonal factor mispricing is induced by seasonal variations in mood.

Simple trading strategy
The investment universe comprises common stocks traded on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.

We estimate mood beta (predictor) for each asset with time-series regressions (eq. (3)) from dependent variable, which is the asset’s historical excess returns earned during prespecified and realized high and low mood months (𝑋𝑅𝐸𝑇_𝑖,MoodMonth) on the control variable which is contemporaneous equal-weighted CRSP (market) excess returns (𝑋𝑅𝐸𝑇_𝐴,MoodMonth)), using a 10-year rolling window by requiring a minimum of 40 observations. The regression thus includes eight months in a year: four prespecified (January, March, September, and October) and four realized high and low mood months (the top two and bottom two months with the highest and lowest realized equal-weighted market returns). The estimated 𝛽^Mood_𝑖_month is called the monthly mood beta, and measures the average return change of an asset (individual stock) in response to a one-percent aggregate return change in the identified historical mood months.

Each month, we sort all selected number of stocks into deciles based on their average historical mood beta β^Mood_Month during years t−2 through t−5 and calculate equal-weighted portfolio returns.

The long-short portfolios based on mood beta go long the highest decile and short the lowest mood beta decile during the high-mood months (January and March) and flip the long and short lags during the low-mood months (September and October). Strategy is reevaluated at the end of the month, performed 4 months each year in total.
