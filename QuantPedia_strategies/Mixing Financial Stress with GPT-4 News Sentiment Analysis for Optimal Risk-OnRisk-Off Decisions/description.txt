This paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly ChatGPT, in enhancing sentiment analysis for financial news and its impact on investment strategies. It addresses the limitations of traditional sentiment analysis methods and highlights recent advancements such as BERT, FinBERT, and FinEntity, which have improved the precision of sentiment extraction. The study introduces a novel approach combining sentiment analysis from daily Bloomberg market summaries with a financial stress indicator to develop a robust risk-on/risk-off investment strategy. The methodology includes comprehensive backtesting across three equity markets to compare the effectiveness of strategies that integrate news sentiment with stress indicators versus traditional approaches. The findings suggest that the hybrid strategy consistently outperforms others, offering superior risk-adjusted returns. The paper concludes with a discussion on the dynamic strategy’s efficacy and recommendations for future research.

Fundamental reason
The effectiveness of the novel risk-on, risk-off strategy is grounded in several fundamental factors. First, the strategy leverages ChatGPT for sentiment analysis of financial news, which significantly enhances its capability to understand and interpret market conditions. By processing and analyzing data from Bloomberg’s daily market summaries, GPT-4 provides a nuanced view of sentiment that traditional methods often miss. This advanced language model captures subtle trends and shifts in financial news, offering a more accurate and timely sentiment signal. Moreover, the strategy combines this sentiment analysis with a financial stress indicator that incorporates volatility and credit spreads. This combination ensures that the approach benefits from both broad market insights and immediate news impacts. The stress indicator provides a macroeconomic perspective on market stability, while the sentiment analysis focuses on specific news events. This dual approach creates a more comprehensive and robust investment strategy. The adaptability of the strategy is another crucial factor. By dynamically switching between using both the sentiment and stress index signals or relying solely on the stress index, the strategy can adjust to periods when the sentiment signal alone may be less reliable. This flexibility helps mitigate potential underperformance and ensures that the strategy remains effective across varying market conditions. The broad applicability of the strategy across different equity markets further underscores its robustness. Empirical validation has shown that the approach consistently performs well in diverse markets, including NASDAQ, S&P 500, and other major indices. This versatility highlights the strategy’s ability to generalize and adapt to various investment environments. Lastly, the superior risk-adjusted returns achieved by the strategy are indicative of its effectiveness. The strategy’s higher Sharpe and Calmar ratios, which measure return relative to risk, reflect its capacity to deliver better performance while minimizing maximum drawdowns. This enhances overall investment outcomes, making the strategy a compelling option for investors looking to optimize their risk-reward balance.

Simple trading strategy
To develop an effective investment strategy across various equity markets by integrating financial news with a stress index indicator, a comprehensive data collection and analysis approach is essential. Here is an overview of the data components involved in this strategy:

News Data: The cornerstone of the strategy is the financial news collected from Bloomberg. Bloomberg’s daily market wraps, which have been available since 2010, provide comprehensive summaries of key financial events. These reports, typically around 7,000 characters long, cover a range of topics including equities, currencies, cryptocurrencies, bonds, and commodities. The data collection focuses on the end-of-day Asian market wraps, ensuring a consistent dataset of 3,627 daily summaries. Each summary contains detailed information and insights on market movements, offering a valuable resource for sentiment analysis.

News Signal: The sentiment analysis of news is performed using a method adapted from previous studies. The process involves several steps:

1. Collect daily market summaries from Bloomberg to track financial trends.
2. Use ChatGPT to generate 15 notable headlines from these summaries to capture significant events.
3. Assess the sentiment of each headline, categorizing them as positive, negative, or indecisive, and assign numerical scores accordingly.
4. Aggregate these daily sentiment scores over a 10-day period to smooth out fluctuations and identify overall trends.
5. Apply z-scoring to the 10-day average to normalize the sentiment data and calculate a binary news indicator based on the z-score trend.

Stress Index: The stress index, derived from Guilleminot et al. (2014), is used to gauge market stress and anticipate potential crises. This index combines various market indicators, including CDS contracts, to provide a comprehensive view of financial stress. It offers several advantages over traditional indicators like the VIX:

– It includes a broad range of risk indicators, enhancing its ability to capture market contagion.
– It uses z-score normalization to allow for better comparability across different markets.
– It incorporates data from major banks, insurance companies, and governments to detect signals related to market crises.

Using Large Language Models (LLMs): LLMs have revolutionized sentiment analysis by providing advanced capabilities to process and interpret complex financial news. To handle the intricacies of financial articles, the Chain of Thought method is employed. This involves breaking down the analysis into manageable parts, such as summarizing the text and then assessing the sentiment of these summaries. This approach enhances accuracy by focusing on smaller, clearer sections of text and aggregating the results to form an overall sentiment view.

Stress Signal Computation: The computation of the stress index involves:

1. Collecting market data for various assets, including indicators like the VIX and CDS index.
2. Standardizing this data using z-scores to account for variability.
3. Aggregating z-scores across asset categories to create category-specific stress indicators.
4. Averaging these indicators to form a comprehensive stress index.
5. Normalizing the final index value to a scale between 0 and 1 using the cumulative distribution function.

Markets Tested: The strategy is evaluated across six equity markets: NASDAQ, S&P 500, Nikkei, Euro Stoxx, and Emerging Markets, spanning from January 2005 to 2024. The performance of the strategy is compared in three scenarios:

1. Applying the strategy to the S&P 500 alone.
2. Applying the strategy to the NASDAQ alone.
3. Applying the strategy to an equally weighted basket of the six equity markets.

This multi-faceted approach ensures a robust evaluation of the strategy’s effectiveness across different market conditions and regions.
