The paper presents a new approach to statistical arbitrage by using graph clustering algorithms to identify groups of correlated stocks. Statistical arbitrage strategies seek to exploit price discrepancies among similar assets, typically using techniques like pairs trading. The authors propose a more flexible strategy by focusing on a model-agnostic framework. Overall, the paper contributes to the field of statistical arbitrage by demonstrating how advanced clustering techniques can be used to construct profitable arbitrage portfolios. This approach opens new avenues for exploiting mean-reversion in correlated stock groups, providing an innovative alternative to traditional statistical arbitrage methods.

Fundamental reason
The paper’s approach to statistical arbitrage focuses on identifying groups of correlated stocks and building portfolios that exploit temporary price deviations among these groups. The framework relies on clustering algorithms to partition stocks into clusters with high internal correlation and low external correlation. By examining market residual returns, the authors isolate stock-specific behavior from broader market trends, providing a more precise foundation for clustering. Once these clusters are identified, the strategy adopts a contrarian approach, taking long positions on stocks that have underperformed and short positions on those that have outperformed. This technique aims to capitalize on mean-reversion patterns within each cluster, seeking economically significant profits. The paper’s innovation lies in its use of advanced graph-based clustering algorithms, such as SPONGE, Spectral, and Signed Laplacian clustering, to manage both positive and negative correlations in the residual returns. This approach differentiates it from traditional statistical arbitrage strategies and portfolio construction methods, introducing a flexible and robust method for exploiting arbitrage opportunities.

Simple trading strategy
The data used in this analysis comes from the CRSP daily returns database, spanning January 2000 to December 2022. The stock universe includes shares listed on the NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ exchanges. To maintain a realistic trading environment, the study only incorporates stocks in the top 25th percentile of market capitalization, resulting in about 600 stocks each trading day. This is determined by the closing price and the number of shares outstanding. The data includes prices adjusted for stock splits and dividends, ensuring accurate return calculations.

In addition to these stocks, the performance of portfolios constructed with clustering algorithms is compared with a benchmark portfolio based on industry classifications, specifically the Fama–French 12 industry sectors. These sectors include industries such as nondurables, durables, manufacturing, energy, chemicals, business equipment, telecommunications, utilities, shops, healthcare, finance, and others.

The data analysis involves various methodologies to assess the effectiveness of clustering algorithms in constructing arbitrage portfolios. Statistical performance metrics, like the Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio, are used to evaluate the portfolios, providing insights into the stability and risk-adjusted returns.The following steps outline the construction of zero-cost statistical arbitrage portfolios based on a novel clustering approach.

Step 1: Data Pre-processing
Calculate Market Residual Returns: Determine each stock’s residual return, which is the part of its return not explained by market movements. This is done by subtracting the effect of the market return from the raw return of each stock.
Step 2: Construct the Correlation Matrix
Organize Residual Returns: Gather residual returns for a set number of days and for a specific list of stocks, creating a matrix where each row represents a day and each column represents a stock.
Create the Correlation Matrix: Use the residual returns to compute a correlation matrix, indicating the strength of the relationship between different stocks.
Step 3: Apply Spectral Clustering
Build the Laplacian Matrix: Create a matrix from the correlation data that helps identify clusters. This matrix represents the connections between stocks, where higher values indicate stronger relationships.
Extract K Clusters: Find a reduced set of features from the Laplacian matrix and use these to divide stocks into distinct clusters using a clustering algorithm, such as k-means++.
Step 4: Construct Zero-Cost Portfolios
Identify Mean-Reverting Stocks: Within each cluster, look for stocks that tend to revert to their average behavior. This characteristic is the basis for constructing zero-cost portfolios.
Assign Portfolio Weights: Build portfolios that are cost-neutral by balancing long positions in stocks expected to rise and short positions in those likely to fall. This approach aims to capture profits from reversion to the mean within each cluster.
Step 5: Backtesting and Strategy Evaluation
Backtest the Strategy: Test the constructed portfolios on historical data to evaluate their performance. Analyze key metrics like returns and risk levels to assess the strategy’s effectiveness.
Rebalance Periodically: As stock relationships and market conditions change, it’s important to periodically revisit and adjust the clusters and portfolios to maintain the strategy’s effectiveness.
This strategy demonstrates how signed and directed graph clustering can be applied to construct zero-cost statistical arbitrage portfolios. By focusing on residual returns and mean-reverting behavior, it provides a robust approach to arbitrage. Regular re-evaluation and backtesting are crucial to adapt to changing market dynamics and ensure sustained profitability.
