Both academics and practitioners see the options market as a place where the most sophisticated investors trade. It is, therefore, understandable that information derived from the option markets should have a predictive ability for the ordinary equity market. Academic research shows that the most usable indicators are OTM volatility skewness, the spread between realized and implied volatility, ATM volatility skewness, and a change in the ATM volatility skewness. An indicator which combines information from all four of them successfully predicts a cross-section of future returns for the 100 largest stocks; therefore, an equity long-short strategy based on it could be constructed.

Fundamental reason
Academic research speculates that traders prefer to exploit private information by trading in the options market because the option market provides reduced transaction costs, increased financial leverage and a lack of short-selling constraints. If equity-market investors fail to trade on this information, a lead-lag relationship will emerge between the options market and stock market.

Simple trading strategy
The investment universe consists of the 100 largest stocks from the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ exchanges.

Every week, options with a remaining maturity of approximately one month are selected for each stock. Options are then separated into at-the-money (ATM) and out-of-the-money (OTM) options. A put or call option is defined as an ATM when the ratio of the strike price to the stock price is between 0.95 and 1.05 and a put option as OTM when the ratio is lower than 0.95 but higher than 0.80. When multiple options fall into the same group, the investor selects options with a moneyness closest to 1.00 (ATM) or 0.95 (OTM).

The first options market measure used is the OTM volatility skew, which is calculated as the difference between the implied volatility of the OTM put and ATM call. This measure should reflect worries about negative price movements – stocks with a high volatility skew should, therefore, underperform stocks with a lower skew.

The second measure is the realized (historical) versus implied volatility spread, which is calculated as the difference between the realized volatility of the past 20 daily stock returns and the implied volatility (the average of the implied volatility of the ATM call and ATM put option). This measure should capture the volatility risk of a stock – stocks with a high realized versus implied volatility spread should underperform.

The third measure is the ATM volatility skew, which is calculated as the difference between the implied volatility of the ATM put option and call option. This measure is related to the trading activity of informed investors and jump premia – stocks with a high ATM volatility skew should underperform.

The fourth measure is the change in the ATM volatility skew, which is calculated as the weekly change in the volatility spread between the ATM put and call options. This measure is thought to reflect a change in informed trading – an increasing (decreasing) spread between the implied volatilities of an ATM put and call options should predict lower (higher) stock returns.

The values of each individual variable are transformed into a cross-sectional standardized score (z-score which is constructed by subtracting each variable’s cross-sectional median from the values of the variable and dividing this by its median absolute deviation. The combined z-score is then calculated as the simple, naïve average of all four standardized variables. Stocks are then ranked into quintile portfolios, and the investor goes long on the top quintile, and he/she goes short on the bottom quintile.

A summary indicator is calculated every Tuesday. A one-day lag between the strategy signals and portfolio construction is implemented; therefore, stocks are bought at Wednesday’s closing prices. The portfolio is rebalanced every week and stocks are equally-weighted.

Hedge for stocks during bear markets
Not known - Source and related research papers don’t offer insight into the correlation structure of the proposed trading strategy to equity market risk. Therefore we do not know if this strategy can be used as a hedge/diversification during the time of market crisis. The strategy is built as a long-short, but it can be split into two parts. The long leg of the strategy is surely strongly correlated to the equity market; however, the short-only leg might be used as a hedge during bad times. Rigorous backtest is, however, needed to determine return/risk characteristics and correlation.
