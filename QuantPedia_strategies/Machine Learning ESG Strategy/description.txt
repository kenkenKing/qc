This paper examines the relationship between environmental sustainability and asset returns amid the backdrop of climate change. It highlights the growing importance of environmental metrics for firms, investors, and policymakers. The paper challenges traditional notions about how high environmental scores should affect returns, citing unexpected shocks and increased demand for green assets as factors that can lead to counterintuitive results. The study identifies limitations in aggregate environmental scores and employs machine learning to explore the impact of granular environmental variables on asset returns. It finds that environmental variables, especially Scope 3 CO2 emissions and operational factors, significantly predict stock returns. The paper underscores the need for firms to consider a broader range of environmental factors to gain favorable market valuations during the transition to a green economy.

Fundamental reason
The strategies presented in this paper derive their functionality from several key factors. They are grounded in the rising importance of environmental sustainability, catering to the growing demand for environmentally responsible investment opportunities in the face of climate change. Utilizing granular environmental data, these strategies provide a nuanced understanding of a company’s environmental performance, including factors like Scope 3 emissions and operational metrics. Machine learning techniques enhance predictive accuracy by capturing complex, nonlinear relationships among environmental variables and asset returns. By identifying firms with superior environmental performance, the strategies offer a means of mitigating environmental and climate-related risks in investment portfolios, generating alpha, promoting transparency, and encouraging a long-term investment perspective, ultimately aligning with the transition to a green economy.

METHODOLOGY
In the section 2 of the paper, three distinct machine learning methods are introduced and subsequently applied to examine the impact of environmental variables on asset returns.

Random Forest (RF): This method is based on decision trees and works by partitioning the data into groups of observations that exhibit similar behavior. It builds multiple trees using bootstrapped samples and, in each tree, selects the best variables for splitting nodes. The predicted returns are calculated as averages within each partition. The paper explores various scenarios by altering the number of trees and tree depths to assess their effects on model performance.

Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT): In contrast to Random Forest, GBRT employs many shallow trees and combines their forecasts iteratively. This ensemble approach mitigates overfitting and enhances model stability. The paper discusses different combinations of hyperparameters, such as the number of trees and learning rates, to optimize model performance.

Robust Elastic Net (RENET): This method addresses issues related to correlated explanatory variables and outliers in financial data. It combines a Huber robust objective function with an elastic net penalty function to select relevant features. The Huber loss function is used for robustness in the presence of outliers. The elastic net penalty combines LASSO (L1) and RIDGE (L2) penalties for variable selection and coefficient shrinkage.

The paper also outlines its performance evaluation approach, which includes assessing models based on out-of-sample uncentered R-squares and long-short portfolio returns. The use of different training, validation, and out-of-sample test samples is emphasized to optimize and evaluate the models effectively.

DATA
In the section 3, the authors utilize environmental data from Refinitiv, offering extensive coverage of granular environmental variables, with a dataset dated from January 2020. They note that this date precedes the reevaluation of firms’ final ESG ratings in April 2020, emphasizing the stability of the underlying environmental indicators. The dataset includes around 1,500 firms, with 25% to 30% coverage of continuous environmental variables among Compustat firms. To ensure data quality, the authors impose strict criteria, requiring environmental variables to cover at least 60% of firm-year observations, and observations with missing values for over 20% of environmental variables are excluded. The dataset comprises 81 environmental variables, including emissions, innovation, and resource use, represented as both continuous and dummy variables. The authors employ a rolling analysis methodology, starting from 2007, with training, validation, and out-of-sample test samples shifting over time. Additionally, the paper compares the predictive power of environmental variables with 20 firm characteristics known to predict stock returns, resulting in a comprehensive dataset for their analysis.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
In the section 4, the authors present their findings. They start by demonstrating that machine learning methods yield statistically significant out-of-sample R-squares, surpassing those of traditional OLS methods. They then reveal that long-short portfolios constructed using return forecasts from these machine learning methods consistently generate significant average returns and abnormal returns. Furthermore, the forecasted returns are positively related to future realized returns in Fama-MacBeth regressions. The authors discuss variable selection results, illustrating which environmental variables are particularly influential in predicting returns. Finally, they provide evidence that these long-short portfolios are sensitive to climate concern shocks, indicating that the portfolios perform better during periods of heightened climate concerns.

Here’s a simplified trading strategy based on the findings presented in Table 3:

Trading Strategy: Green Stocks vs. Brown Stocks

Objective: To capitalize on the performance difference between green and brown stocks identified in Table 3.

Assumptions:
You have access to the environmental performance data or relevant forecasts used in Table 3.
You can implement trades with low transaction costs.
Historical performance patterns will continue.
Steps:

1. Data Collection:
Gather environmental performance data or forecasts for a set of stocks you want to trade. Ensure you have the same metrics used in the study, such as those related to emissions, innovation, and resource use.
2. Ranking:
Use the same machine learning methods (RF, GBRT, or RENET) to forecast returns for your selected stocks, based on their environmental performance metrics.
Rank the stocks from highest forecasted returns (green stocks) to lowest forecasted returns (brown stocks) using the chosen machine learning method.

3.Portfolio Construction:
Create a long portfolio with the top decile of green stocks (those with the highest forecasted returns).
Create a short portfolio with the bottom decile of brown stocks (those with the lowest forecasted returns).
Ensure your long and short positions are balanced in terms of capital allocation.

4. Rebalancing:
Rebalance your portfolio regularly, such as on a monthly or quarterly basis, to maintain the long and short positions in the top and bottom deciles, respectively.

5. Risk Management:
Implement risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders or position size limits, to protect your portfolio from significant losses.

6. Monitoring:
Continuously monitor the performance of your long-short portfolio and make adjustments as needed.

7. Exit Strategy:
Consider exiting the trade if the environmental performance data or forecasts significantly change or if the strategy is no longer generating positive returns.
Remember that past performance does not guarantee future results, and it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and backtesting before implementing any trading strategy. Additionally, consider consulting with a financial advisor or professional before making significant investment decisions.
