(Cho from World Bank, 2024) ChatGPT can generate stock tickers to buy and sell for day trading and presents the day trading strategy based on ChatGPT day trading signals. ChatGPT’s generative feature works for empirical asset pricing to generate relevant outputs. Furthermore, the portfolio performance is not attributable to some stocks that are directly mentioned in the input news articles, which suggests that the generative feature of ChatGPT works to select relevant stocks by analyzing input news articles. The sell side of the recommendation from ChatGPT brings significant retail attention. It induces substantial overnight return reversal for the short leg of the strategy. That trading strategy based on ChatGPT’s buy and sell signals earns significant long-short returns in open-to-close intraday trading.

Fundamental reason
This paper sheds light on the literature by showing a new method of prompt engineering that provides multiple news articles, including firm-specific and macro news. This can be considered a factor model estimating latent factor structures from macroeconomic data or economy-wide variables and estimating individual firms’ exposure to the factors. Unlike the prior literature, which provides only firm-specific news to ChatGPT to get firm-specific signals, the author provides multiple firm-specific and non-firm-specific news to generate lists of stock tickers to buy and sell. Findings suggest the applicability of the LLM-based model in making a factor model.

Simple trading strategy
The investment universe consists of stocks with share codes 10 and 11 traded in NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.
(As input prompts, Twitter raw text data was collected from Refinitiv Eikon News Monitor. Stock-day-level signals are then evaluated by the daily CRSP individual stock returns data.)

Ask for a prompt specifying ChatGPT to trade as a professional day trader by analyzing multiple news articles to generate at least 100 stocks to buy and sell. (Prompt example on pg. 8.) Make distinct batches for each Intraday News and Overnight News.
The final portfolio uses the NET_BUY and NET_SELL signals by their different long-short spread.
NET_BUY and NET_SELL signals are obtained by taking the difference between SUM_BUY and SUM_SELL signals. A stock with a SUM_BUY signal greater than its SUM_SELL signal has a positive NET_BUY signal, which is the difference between SUM_BUY and SUM_SELL signals. NET_SELL signal is similarly constructed for stocks having a SUM_SELL signal greater than their SUM_BUY signals by taking their differences. By construction, NET_BUY and NET_SELL signals are positive. (For example, if MSFT has a SUM_BUY signal of 60 and a SUM_SELL signal of 20, then MSFT has a NET_BUY signal of 40. In the case of BBBY in my previous example, which shows that BBBY is selected two times for the BUY list and 47 times for the SELL list, then BBBY has NET_SELL signal as 45.)

Hold stocks from the market opening to closing. NET_BUY (NET_SELL) portfolio is constructed by weighting stocks using the NET_BUY (NET_SELL) signal as explained: With the 30 iterations of producing each buy and sell list, MSFT is selected 26 times in the BUY list and 12 times in the SELL list. Accordingly, 14 can be considered a net buy (NET_BUY) signal by netting the BUY and SELL signals. Besides the batch of this example, there is one more Overnight News batch and one more Intraday News batch. Since I repeat 30 times for each of the three batches, the maximum number of BUY or SELL signals is 90. The three batches have a total of 728 tweets with 25,069 tokens. MSFT appears 80 times in BUY lists and 20 times in SELL lists, resulting in a 60 NET_BUY signal.
