This paper introduces a forecast model for predicting stock illiquidity at a monthly horizon, which fills a gap in the existing literature that focuses on forecasting credit risk and volatility but neglects liquidity. The authors propose a procedure that combines past realized data with stock and firm characteristics to predict future stock liquidity. They address the challenge of capturing time-series patterns in liquidity by using a predictor selection algorithm. The results demonstrate that the forecast procedure successfully predicts individual stock liquidity, outperforming the use of previous month’s realized liquidity. The paper also explores the relationship between predicted changes in liquidity and average stock returns. While the level of liquidity itself does not show a robust relation to returns, the predicted changes in liquidity are found to be strongly related to average stock returns. This result holds true even when adjusting for risk factors. The authors explain this finding by studying the behavior of different investor groups, showing that short-term investors react immediately to changes in expected liquidity, while long-term investors primarily rely on realized liquidity. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the liquidity forecast model for practitioners and suggesting avenues for future research.

Fundamental reason
The fundamental reason for this paper is to address the lack of research related to forecasting liquidity in the finance literature, despite the recognized importance of liquidity for asset prices and its close relation to volatility. The authors aim to fill this gap by proposing a forecast model that predicts individual stock liquidity at a monthly horizon. The paper builds on the existing literature on predicting stock volatility and utilizes a variant of the heterogeneous auto-regressive forecast model. One of the challenges in predicting stock liquidity is capturing time-series patterns such as the flight-to-liquidity phenomenon and the impact of macroeconomic news. To address this issue, the authors employ a predictor selection algorithm (elastic net) that dynamically chooses among a set of predictor candidates to maximize forecast performance. The results of the forecast procedure show that the model is able to predict individual stock liquidity with improved accuracy compared to using past realized liquidity. The forecast performance of the procedure increases over time, indicating its effectiveness in capturing liquidity expectations. Furthermore, the paper explores the relationship between predicted changes in stock liquidity and average stock returns. While the level of liquidity does not show a robust relation to average stock returns, the predicted changes in liquidity exhibit a strong relation to average stock returns. The authors demonstrate this by sorting stocks into portfolios based on their expected change in illiquidity and observing significant excess returns for portfolios with the largest predicted increase in illiquidity.

1. Forecasting Individual Stock Liquidity

This part of the article focuses on forecasting individual stock liquidity. The authors use two liquidity measures: the Amihud measure and the effective spread from Trade and Quote (TAQ) data. They transform the Amihud measure by taking the natural logarithm to reduce skewness and excess kurtosis. The authors also consider various predictor variables to forecast stock liquidity, including past realizations of liquidity measures, trading volume, firm size, book-to-market ratio, and stock returns.
To forecast stock liquidity, the authors adopt a forecast model inspired by the literature on forecasting realized stock volatility. They use a linear forecast model that incorporates realized liquidity aggregated over different time horizons. They deviate from the standard model by including additional predictor variables and accounting for time-series variation in illiquidity. The forecast procedure involves three steps: selecting the set of predictor variables, calibrating the model parameters using a rolling window of five years of data, and performing an out-of-sample forecast for the next month.
The data used in the study includes daily and monthly stock market data from CRSP, covering the period from June 1963 to December 2022. The sample is restricted to common stocks traded at NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ, excluding stocks in the financial or utility industry. Summary statistics are presented to provide an overview of the data.
The forecast results indicate that the proposed model outperforms a naïve benchmark that assumes no change in liquidity. The model reduces the forecast error by around 12% compared to the benchmark. The improvement in forecast accuracy is consistent across different market phases. The variables selected by the forecast model include current and past liquidity measures, volatility of liquidity, stock returns, trading volume, firm size, and book-to-market ratio.
The authors conclude that incorporating information over different time periods is beneficial for stock liquidity forecasts. They highlight the importance of the time series of stock liquidity measures as the most significant determinant of future liquidity. The model’s forecast estimates are compared to realized changes in liquidity, and portfolios are created based on expected changes in liquidity to assess the economic relevance of the forecasts.

2. Liquidity Forecasts and Average Stock Returns
In this part is examined the relationship between liquidity forecasts, stock liquidity levels, and average stock returns. The existing literature has shown mixed results regarding the pricing of stock illiquidity in average stock returns. Some studies find a positive premium for illiquidity, while others do not find a significant relation after controlling for various factors. The authors aim to contribute to this discussion by incorporating expectations about future illiquidity in their analysis.
The authors investigate the association between current stock liquidity levels and average stock returns. They sort stocks into portfolios based on their realized liquidity levels and calculate portfolio returns for the subsequent month. The results indicate that higher current illiquidity does not lead to higher average stock returns after controlling for the influence of small-cap stocks. They also find similar results when using liquidity forecasts instead of current realized liquidity.
Next, the authors examine the relationship between predicted changes in liquidity and average stock returns. They form portfolios based on predicted changes in the next month’s stock liquidity levels. The findings reveal that stocks with the highest predicted increase in illiquidity generate significantly higher average excess returns, while stocks with the largest predicted decrease in illiquidity do not show a significant relation to returns. The results hold even after controlling for risk factors.
The interaction between current illiquidity levels, predicted changes in illiquidity, and average stock returns, is next examined. Stocks are sorted into portfolios based on both current illiquidity and predicted changes in illiquidity. The analysis shows that among stocks with the lowest realized illiquidity, predicted changes in illiquidity do not have a significant impact on returns. However, among stocks with the highest realized illiquidity, predicted changes in illiquidity are strongly associated with higher average excess returns.
To provide a more comprehensive analysis, the authors employ Fama and MacBeth regressions, separating the effects of current illiquidity and predicted changes in illiquidity on stock returns. The results suggest that while current illiquidity does not have a significant relation to future stock returns, predicted changes in illiquidity are positively related to returns when controlling for liquidity-related variables.
This paper finds that predicted changes in illiquidity are priced in the cross-section of stock returns. Investors demand a significant compensation for expected changes in future illiquidity, indicating that liquidity expectations play a role in determining average stock returns. However, the paper does not find evidence of a significant relation between current stock liquidity levels and average stock returns after considering various factors.

3. Where Does the Pricing of Expected Liquidity Come From?
This section of the paper explores the economic explanation for the impact of expected liquidity changes on stock returns. The authors analyze the behavior of short-term and long-term investors and find that short-term investors react immediately to changes in expected liquidity by adjusting their portfolios, while long-term investors prefer illiquid stocks. They also compare predicted changes in liquidity with observed liquidity shocks and find a high negative correlation between the two. The results suggest that expected liquidity changes and liquidity shocks have separate effects on stock returns, emphasizing the importance of considering both factors.

4 Robustness using the effective spread as liquidity measure
The authors create a second dataset using the effective spread as the liquidity measure. They include realized stock liquidity values from the current month, the past quarter, and the past year, as well as the standard deviation of liquidity from the current month and the past year. The forecasting model’s performance is evaluated by comparing it with a naïve benchmark. The results show that the forecasting model reduces the forecast error by a significant percentage, although lower compared to the Amihud measure. The selected variables for the forecast procedure include the current month’s effective spread, the effective spread over the past quarter, and the log-transformed trading volume. The analysis further compares predicted changes in liquidity with realized changes, confirming the alignment between forecast estimates and realized changes in illiquidity.
In section 5.2, the authors examine the robustness of their findings by using the effective spread as an alternative liquidity measure. They conduct single-sorted and double-sorted portfolio analyses and Fama and MacBeth regressions. The results indicate that portfolios with predicted changes in the effective spread generate monthly excess returns and alphas. The findings are consistent in both equally-weighted and value-weighted portfolios. Additionally, cross-sectional regression analyses demonstrate significant relationships between predicted changes in the effective spread and average stock returns, even when controlling for liquidity-related factors. These robustness analyses support the main conclusions of the paper and validate the forecasting model’s effectiveness in predicting changes in liquidity and their impact on stock returns.
