Presented paper empirically examines systematic trend-following and global macro strategies, highlighting their individual merits and the synergistic benefits of their integration. By accounting for the scale of previous price changes, the model refined by scientists captures nuanced market signals, offering an edge over conventional trend-following frameworks. The global macro strategy’s use of renewed lagged economic indicators is well-used to inform asset positioning further, and delineates the relationship between macroeconomic forces and market dynamics. The combined portfolio approach, allocating a significant weight to trend-following due to its empirical robustness and broad asset coverage, yields a superior Sharpe ratio, indicating an optimal risk-return balance. Rather very complex execution is a little disadvantage, but this interesting approach and excellent example makes its way into our encyclopedia.

Fundamental reason
In this study, scientists advance trend-following methodologies by integrating the magnitude of past returns, a departure from traditional models that consider only direction. This novel approach significantly boosts the strategy’s predictive capabilities, as demonstrated by their robust empirical results. This innovation strengthens the strategy’s foundational premise and enriches its application, potentially setting a new benchmark for trend-following in the realm of systematic investment strategies. Notably, the negative correlation of the combined portfolio with the MSCI US Index points to its value as a diversification tool within a broader investment context. The performance metrics underscore this. In conclusion, the strategies examined offer compelling alternatives to traditional market benchmarks, providing valuable avenues for portfolio diversification and risk management.

High-level Overview: Generate asset weights based on trend-following and global macro analyses, focusing on historical performance trends and macroeconomic indicators. These preliminary weights are then processed through the risk-parity framework. This phase focuses on adjusting the weights derived from the first stage to ensure equalized risk contributions from each asset. This comprehensive approach combines the foresight of trend and macro analysis with the risk-balanced discipline of risk-parity providing a well-rounded strategy for asset allocation:

1. To calculate the optimal weights for portfolio assets, minimize the difference between each asset’s contribution to portfolio risk and the risk parity target via computing sequential Least-Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) by solving eq. (3).
2. Trend-following is a strategy that seeks to capture gains or mitigate losses by investing in assets that have exhibited upward or downward trends over a predefined time horizon. To do so, trend-following employs a multi-timeframe approach, considering asset returns over the past 1, 3, and 12 months. Each of these is adjusted for its respective volatility, computed over a rolling 36-month window as in eq. (4). Aggregate these risk-adjusted signals across the 1, 3, and 12-month time-frames by averaging them.
3. Global macro strategy analyzes the directional impact of changes in key economic indicators (listen as from 3.3 Global Macro) on various asset classes: calculate the change as the relative change, calculated as (current value − previous value)/previous value (and employ an x-month lags as listed in the section).
4. The combined strategy is designed to go long (on best) or (sell) short (the worst ones) in equity indices, government bonds, and currencies by following the trend and leveraging lagged fundamental indicators like GDP, CPI, interest rates, and exchange rates at the same time.

The combined portfolio, re-balanced monthly (when new CPI data comes in), has an 80% weight in trend-following and 20% in global macro. It is designed to leverage the broader empirical support and asset range of trend-following while capitalizing on the global macro’s strengths (combining the trend-following and integrated global macro strategies).
